1) SAM
{confused} Who are you guys?
2) CULTIST1
We are the Boxists, the last keepers of the True Way.
3) CULTIST2
While our brothers have succumbed to the siren song of secular America, {stern}with its basalt-rich tunnels and specialty coffees, {proud}only we remain to act as Guardians of the Box.
4) SAM
{confused}What’s with the creepy toybox?
5) CULTIST2
It is everything and nothing, {proud}the power infinite!
6) SAM
{sarcastic}Oh, well that makes sense.
7) CULTIST1
We have guarded and {proud}worshipped it from behind the shadowy veil of faith for generations.
8) CULTIST2
{normal}Some of us had grown to believe it was just an allegory.{stern} I’m looking at you, Jebediah.
9) CULTIST1
{proud}But the veil has been lifted! There it is, before us, just as the tablets foretold!
10) SAM
{confused}What’s inside that toybox, anyway?
11) CULTIST1
No one knows! {surprised}No one has seen it for thousands of years!
12) CULTIST2
There are those who believe it contains... toys!
13) CULTIST1
{stern}[sarcastic] Oh, right. Like the Creator of All Things is really some fanciful box in the sky filled with magical toys. [to Sam]You’ll have to excuse Obediah. He’s a fundamentalist.
14) SAM
Before, it sounded like you were expecting to see Max and me.
15) CULTIST1
{proud}Yes! Your coming was foretold in the sacred tablets and scrolls!
16) CULTIST2
[as if quoting scripture] “And yea, the Devil Bunny, knowing not his true purpose, would unlock the mysteries of the Toybox.”
17) MAX
{realizing}Hey, Sam! {happy}It likes me!
18) CULTIST1
{proud}You know what that means, Obediah!
19) CULTIST2
{proud}[happy, sing-song] It’s time for the apocalypse!
20) CULTIST1
[happy, sing-song] It’s time for the apocalypse!
21) SAM
{confused}What’s that toybox got to do with Max?
22) CULTIST1
{surprised}He must be blessed with the Gift! It will bestow great power to the one who can use its contents!
23) CULTIST2
{proud}[still happy] And don’t forget about the apocalypse!
24) SAM
{realizing}You guys seem {sarcastic}awfully chipper about the end times.
25) CULTIST2
It’s just nice to be proven right for once!
26) CULTIST1
{proud}Yeah, suck on that, Barry Diggory! {stern}Who’s wearing a stupid-looking robe NOW?
27) SAM
{confused}Is there anything in your scriptures about how we can defeat Skunkape?
28) CULTIST1
{surprised}Just that the box will show you the way!
29) CULTIST2
{normal}[as if quoting scripture] “And then the Devil Bunny and His Chubby Sidekick...”
30) SAM
{stern}[offended] Hey!
31) CULTIST2
{normal}[continuing scripture] “...broke down the wall and slew the Betrayer of Mole Men.”
32) SAM
I gotta turn on this machine to stop a gorilla.
33) CULTIST1
Down the tunnel, first door to your right.
34) SAM
{incredulous}No, I literally have to stop a gorilla.
35) CULTIST2
Oh, we know little of your modern inventions. {proud}The Toybox provides all WE need.
36) SAM
{sarcastic}You guys stay crazy.
37) CULTIST1
{proud}Amen!
38) MAX
{incredulous}[sarcastic] Man, the musical numbers have really gone downhill since we’ve been on break.
39) CULTIST2
{proud}We love the box so much, we’ve prepared a song about it... [clears throat]
40) CULTIST2
[weakly singing] We love the Toybox, ‘cause it’s really great...
