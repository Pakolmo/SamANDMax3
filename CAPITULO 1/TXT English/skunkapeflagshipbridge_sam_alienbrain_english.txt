1) SAM
{worried} Stay focused, pal.
2) MAX
[context: asking a brain if he needs anything] {happy} Like a spine?
3) SAM
{enthused} What’s your story, brain? Can we get you anything?
4) SAM
{confused} How did you get here?
5) ALIENBRAIN
I had found a mysterious toy and was using my strange power over it to amaze and delight the ladies of my village. It was then that Skun-ka’pe’s ship landed. He was intrigued with my power and invited me on board his spaceship.
6) MAX
So you just went with him?
7) SAM
{confused} What is Skunkape’s evil scheme, anyhow?
8) ALIENBRAIN
No less than domination of the entire universe!
9) SAM
Did he ever mention anything more specific?
10) ALIENBRAIN
He’s traveling from planet to planet searching for all of the Toys of Power. If he ever manages to collect all of them, he’ll be completely unstoppable!
11) SAM
How are we supposed to stop Skunkape?
12) SAM
Any weaknesses, like he’s powerless against the color yellow? Or he can’t cross running water?
13) MAX
{sarcastic} Or he’s powerless against yellow water?
14) SAM
{Stern} I know what you’re thinking, Max, and stop it.
15) ALIENBRAIN
Apart from that... he always says he has a weakness for potato chips, and he has to eat the whole bag.
16) SAM
Yeah, that doesn’t really help us much.
17) ALIENBRAIN
Sometimes when he’s in the shower, I could swear I hear him crying.
18) SAM
Why did Skunkape come here, to our street?
19) SAM
In the future, you seemed to know all about Max’s psychic powers.
20) ALIENBRAIN
Yes, Max is one with the Gift! The toys have great power, but only to those of us with a special brain.
21) SAM
[conceding] {happy} Well, Max DOES have a special brain.
22) MAX
{happy} That’s what all the teachers said! Well, that and {devilish} “Back! Back! I cast thee out, demon!”
23) ALIENBRAIN
You must use the Gift wisely, Max, and keep it secret from General Skun-ka’pe! The power is every bit as dangerous as it is wicked awesome.
24) SAM
{confused} Why do you think Max’s powers are dangerous? {sarcastic} Apart from the obvious, of course.
25) MAX
{confused} That’s it?
26) ALIENBRAIN
“That’s it”? It’s a toy that lets you teleport across vast distances in the blink of an eye using only the power of your mind! That’s not cool enough for you?
27) SAM
{confused} Where is Skunkape’s collection of magic toys?
28) SAM
{confused} It’s just... we saw more toys in Max’s vision.
29) ALIENBRAIN
More toys? You must not have found them yet! They must still be somewhere in this city!
30) SAM
{confused} What’s that “mole processing” room all about?
97) SAM
{confused} What’s that “mole processing” room all about?
31) ALIENBRAIN
Isn’t it obvious? General Skun-ka’pe is illegally harvesting mole juice!
32) MAX
[context: did you just say...] {confused} Mole juice?
33) ALIENBRAIN
The sweat of the mole man is the most valuable substance in the galaxy! I thought all civilized worlds knew that!
34) SAM
{sarcastic} Our civilization is still in the internet addiction phase of development.
35) SAM
{confused} What does Skunkape want with all that mole man sweat?
36) ALIENBRAIN
Some of it he sells as food additives. It gives sandwiches a tangy kick with half the fat of mayonnaise!
37) ALIENBRAIN
But most of it he uses as engine fuel and lubricant for this spaceship. He sometimes eliminates half a planet’s entire mole man population just to provide enough fuel and oil to travel one system.
38) MAX
{suspicious} Oh, that’s it. Destroying the world, conquering the galaxy: whatever. {angry}But driving a gas-guzzler is where I draw the line.
39) ALIENBRAIN
Oh, nothing exceptional. About six-three, raven-haired... I had what you Earthlings call a “runner’s build...”
40) MAX
{suspicious} I can read minds in the future, you know.
41) ALIENBRAIN
All right, fine. I believe the closest creature you have on your planet is called a “platypus.”
42) SAM
{confused} What did you look like back when you had a body?
43) SAM
Okay, that’s all the evidence we need! {enthused} Let’s go out and deliver some inter-planetary justice, Max!
44) ALIENBRAIN
If you end up cutting out his brain, I call dibs on Skun-ka’pe’s body!
45) SAM
{enthused} Stay oxygenated, brain!
46) ALIENBRAIN
Uh... you, too!
47) ALIENBRAIN
Sam & Max! DO NOT TRUST SKUN-KA’PE! His benevolent facade belies a heart of pure evil!
48) ALIENBRAIN
[awestruck] You mean... you wield the Eyes of Yog-Soggoth? But... but that must mean you ALSO have the Gift!
49) ALIENBRAIN
Sigh. I’ve already told you! You’ve got to find some way to knock General Skun-ka’pe into the Penal Zone!
50) SAM
{confused} What are we supposed to be doing, brain?
51) MAX
{aloof} You’ll have to excuse Sam. He’s new at this.
52) MAX
{sarcastic}It sounded good, though.
53) ALIENBRAIN
Brilliant! I’ll get right on... wait a second, that doesn’t even make sense!
54) SAM
{enthused} I just got an idea! Brain, can you modulate the lower quadrant tachyon emitters to emit a two-thirds pulse stream?
55) MAX
[protesting, then realizing] {confused} But that would generate a zeta wave strong enough to rip through the Van der Graaf polarity... ahhh! {surprised} Which would create a pocket universe in which Skunkape doesn’t even exist!
56) ALIENBRAIN
Don’t ask me. I’ve been watching you two for a while now, and I don’t even understand how you guys survived THIS long.
57) SAM
How are we doing so far, brain?
58) SAM
{confused} Are you okay, brain?
59) ALIENBRAIN
The stress of powering the higher functions of this ship is proving most detergent. Plus I think this broth is starting to go bad.
60) MAX
{confused} You’re looking a little green. Even for you.
61) SAM
How are we supposed to stop Skunkape now?
62) ALIENBRAIN
I don’t know... something about a homing beacon, wasn’t it?
63) SAM
Keep it together, brain!
64) ALIENBRAIN
Okay! Bye now, Grandma!

Bye
71) SAM
[solemn] {sad} He died too soon. I’m assuming. {confused}How are we going to wake him up?
72) MAX
{realizing} You must figure out how to do it eventually, Sam, {incredulous} he was awake in the future.
73) SAM
{enthused} Well, that’s going to be pretty clever of me. {confused}I wonder how I end up doing it.
74) SAM
{enthused} You never realize how disgusting a dried-out alien brain looks until you see it in person.
75) SAM
{Sad} The poor brain’s battery has run out.
76) SAM
{stern} That power core won’t do any good unless we can think of a way to hook it up.
77) SAM
[pickup1] {incredulous} To be fair, Max, your future vision goggles did tip us off.
78) MAX
[pickup1] {sarcastic} The giant fanged spaceship with disintegrator eyes was our first clue.
79) ALIENBRAIN
Look, I don’t know what planet you’re from...
80) ALIENBRAIN
Are you calling me gullible?
81) SAM
[pickup1] {sarcastic} Uh, yeah, we kind of already figured that out.
82) MAX
[pickup1] [context: that came out of nowhere!] {surprised} Uh... what?
83) SAM
[pickup1] {suspicious} This one, actually.
84) ALIENBRAIN
...but on my world, if an alien invites you onto his spaceship, you don’t just ASSUME that he’s going to cut out your brain and keep it in a jar.
85) ALIENBRAIN
I guess we’re just not that cynical.
86) ALIENBRAIN
[pickup3] No, it’s too late for me, I’m afraid. I can only help you put a stop to General Skun-ka’pe’s evil schemes, by controlling the doors and the higher functions of this spaceship.
87) ALIENBRAIN
[pickup3] We must work quickly, before... what is IN this broth? Is that oregano? It’s delightful!
88) ALIENBRAIN
[pickup3] He said he had candy. How was I supposed to know he’d imprison me here, forcing me to use my psychic powers against my will?
89) ALIENBRAIN
He’s been using my strange psychic connection to the Toys of Power to track them throughout the galaxy.
90) ALIENBRAIN
Something very powerful pulled me to this spot. I can only guess it was Max’s discovery of the Eyes of Yog-Soggoth and the Future Vision.
91) ALIENBRAIN
[pickup3] Well, of course the Toys of Power are useless to him without a gifted brain to control them.
92) ALIENBRAIN
[pickup3] General Skun-ka’pe can’t use the Toys of Power himself, so he needs the brain of someone who has the Gift!
93) ALIENBRAIN
[pickup3] He forced me to use my powers so much, that I would have died had you not rescued me!
94) ALIENBRAIN
[pickup3] If he ever found out you have the Gift, Max, he wouldn’t hesitate to do the same to you!
95) ALIENBRAIN
He keeps them on display as a show of power. I’m regaining control over the ship’s functions, so I can reveal them to you. BEHOLD!
96) ALIENBRAIN
[pickup3] That’s where General Skun-ka’pe harvests the mole man sweat he uses for spaceship fuel and lubricant!
98) 
Are you okay?
