1) MOMMABOSCO
{happy}My missing power core! {proud}I knew you were the right one to find it, Flint Paper!
2) FLINT
{arrogant}Ah, it was nothing.
3) MOMMABOSCO
{happy}Now that you’ve returned it, I’ll never ever give it to anyone for any reason at all! Ever!
4) HARRY
{happy}Thanks, Sam & Max! This is exactly what I need to turn my life around!
5) MAX
{happy}[happy, proud] Harry’s got a great big wonderful surprise waiting for him!
6) SAM
{enthused}And to think all it took was this...
7) SAM
{confused}Are you sure you can’t make those future visions last a little longer, Max?
8) MAX
{angry}That would take all the fun out of it!
9) SAM
{sarcastic}I know what would cheer you up, Harry: an all-expenses-paid vacation!
10) HARRY
{happy}[excited] You actually have one of Skun-ka’pe’s golden tickets?
11) HARRY
{embarrassed}[disappointed] Well, it’s a nice gesture, but I don’t take charity. {normal}I’d have to give you something in return.
12) MAX
{sarcastic}Okay, fine. {incredulous}What’ve you got?
13) HARRY
{happy}Oh, lots of stuff! Like... {embarrassed}[dejected]nothing you’d want.
14) SAM
{confused}Uh... you wouldn’t happen to have a lottery ticket, would you?
15) HARRY
Well sure, I buy one every week. {sad}But it’s worthless. I never win anyth— [realizing]{normal}I mean... {happy}it’s incredibly valuable to me. I don’t know if I could part with it.
16) MAX
{sarcastic}[quickly, brush-off] Okay, then. See ya, Harry!
17) HARRY
{normal}[desperate] Wait! I can part with it! Just give me that vacation ticket!
18) HARRY
{happy}So long, suckers! Prepare yourselves, Mole Women of Outer Space! The Love Digger is on his way!
19) SAM
It’s a torn receipt for... {confused}something. {normal}Skunkape must’ve dropped it when he came through here.
20) MAX
{realizing}[excited] A clue! {sarcastic}Which store?
21) SAM
Can’t tell from half a receipt, little buddy. This looks like a job for... {enthused}the Crime-Tron!
22) MOMMABOSCO
{happy}[happy] Gotcha!
23) SUPERBALL
Welcome back, sirs.
24) SAM
{stern}[dismissive] Yeah, yeah. Just tell us how we can get back at Skunkape for crimes against the Freelance Police! And humanity!
25) MAX
{Angry}I say let’s cover him in candy bar wrappers and feed him to starving raccoons!
26) MOMMABOSCO
{enthused}[proudly] I detected a spike in antimatter radiation, so I locked onto the signal from your homing beacon and reversed the polarity of the dimensional stabilization field to intercept— [cut off]
27) SUPERBALL
{Stern}You failed to trap him in the Penal Zone?
28) SAM
{confused}I wouldn’t say “failed,” exactly. {sarcastic}Maybe “underperformed.”
29) MAX
{happy}And we blew up the Penal Zone with an antimatter bomb.
30) SUPERBALL
{normal}Oh dear.
31) MAX
{confused}Uh, what just happened?
32) SAM
We’ll be careful with your rift generator, Momma Bosco.
33) MOMMABOSCO
Just make sure you don’t turn it on until you’ve got that homing beacon on General Skun-ka’pe!
34) MAX
{realizing}[excited] Spoooooky!
35) SAM
{worried}[nervous] M-momma Bosco?
36) HARRY
[process: ghostly whisper] Geeeeettttt... ouuuuuuuttt...
37) HARRY
[friendly] [clears throat] Ahem... Get out of here! It’s Sam & Max!
38) SAM
{suspicious}[disappointed to see him] Uh... hiya, Harry. We were looking for Momma Bosco.
39) HARRY
[ominous] Do not be afraid! Momma Bosco has passed on to the other realms, but I shall attempt to establish a link to—
40) MAX
[casually, matter-of-fact] Oh, there she is! {cocky}Hey, good lookin’!
41) MOMMABOSCO
Oh. {happy}Hey, guys.
42) HARRY
[ominous] Momma Bosco sends greetings from the ethereal planes!
43) MOMMABOSCO
Welcome to the labs! {enthused}You’re my first visitors!
44) HARRY
[offended, emphasis on I] Wait, I was your first visitor!
45) MOMMABOSCO
{sarcastic}[awkward] Right.
46) SAM
{confused}Is this the remote control for your destabilizer thing, Momma Bosco?
47) MOMMABOSCO
{proud}That’s the one. {sarcastic}Make sure you don’t press it before you really need to, because you only get one chance!
48) MINION2
{angry}No visitors!
93) MINION2
{angry}No visitors!
49) SAM
{confused}Can’t we just plug in this dimensional doo-hickey here?
50) MOMMABOSCO
That dimensional rift generator will take a LOT more power than I’ve got.
51) MAX
Plus it’ll blow a fuse if the toaster oven is running.
52) SUPERBALL
You’ll need to use it at a place where the border between reality and nonsense is already weakened, sirs.
53) SAM
Charmingly outdated science textbooks.
54) SAM
[reading book title] “Medical Advancements in Dispelling Evil Humors Via Leeches and Bloodletting.”
55) MAX
{angry}[angry] Hey, that’s mine!
56) SAM
[reading book title] “From The Earth to the Elaborate Moon-Landing Hoax.”
57) SAM
[reading book title] “Breakthrough Technological Discoveries by Women and Also Real Scientists.”
58) SAM
{confused}Does anybody mind if I change the channel?
59) SAM
Harry must’ve dug his way in here.
60) MAX
{confused}Is this the one with the space gorilla?{normal} I’ve already seen it.
61) MAX
{suspicious}They say they don’t like to be in bright sunlight, but I say it’s just an excuse to do more property damage. {devilish}A BRILLIANT excuse.
62) SAM
{realizing}[in awe] If these findings are true, then that would mean... it’s scientifically impossible for Max and me to exist!
63) SAM
{suspicious}Oh, no, wait. I was reading it wrong.
64) SAM
{surprised}[impressed] No way! I didn’t think they’d come out with the XKJ-S3 model yet! {happy}This baby is eight times as fast and has eighteen USB slots!
65) MAX
{confused}What does it do?
66) SAM
No idea.
67) SAM
This thing does science so hard, you say, {surprised}“I’ve never SEEN that much science” {normal}and it’s all, {incredulous}“Check THIS out,” {normal}and then {surprised}BOOM: more science.
68) SAM
Not having to worry about fire safety is one of the many advantages of being a ghost.
69) MAX
{sarcastic}Or being us.
70) SAM
It’s Momma Bosco’s dimensional destabilizer thing.
71) MAX
{realizing}Push that green button! {sarcastic}What’s the worst it could do?
72) MOMMABOSCO
{sarcastic}[matter of factly] Tear a hole in the fabric of existence and bring the Elder Gods back to this dimensional plane.
73) MAX
{worried}Oh. {realizing}What happens if you double-click it?
74) SAM
{stern}That won’t work. These are similar but {realizing}completely separate inventions that open portals to alternate dimensions. {stern}Get it straight.
75) HARRY
So Momma Bosco: after you hire me as your research assistant, we’ll need to talk about my vacation time.
76) SUPERBALL
I suggest you pick up that rift generator and get to work, sirs.

[pickup1] {Sarcastic}If I’m reading this right, Harry’s been swallowing a lot of pride over the last few months, with side dishes of shredded dreams.
95) MAX
[pickup1] {sarcastic}Ooh, look! He still contains trace amounts of hope! That’s so cute.
96) SAM
[pickup1] {surprised}Dr. Momma Bosco’s ghost is made of... ionized air?
97) MAX
[pickup1] {incredulous}Funky.
98) SAM
[pickup1][reading] Flies... mosquitos... fingernails... Fingernails?
99) MAX
[pickup1] {cocky}That’s one tough spider.
100) SAM
[pickup1] {realizing}I’ve always wanted to know what’s in this ghostly goop...
101) SAM
[pickup1][reading] {normal}Cow hooves, lime flavoring, vodka...
102) SAM
[pickup1] {surprised}This isn’t ectoplasm from beyond the veil, Max! It’s a batch of lukewarm gelatin shots!
103) MAX
[pickup1]{sarcastic} Funny, I always pictured Momma Bosco as more of a gin and tonic woman.
104) SAM
[pickup1] Spider webs and spooky houses go together like well-dressed dogs and naked bunnies.
105) MAX
[pickup1] How many times have I told you not to use the ‘b’ word, Sam?
106) SAM
[pickup1] Hey neat, the eerie, oozing remains of Momma Bosco’s ghostly visitations.
107) MAX
[pickup1] That must be ectoplasmic jelly, ‘cause ectoplasmic jam don’t shake like that!
108) SAM
[pickup1] Apparently, it’s the remains of Doctor Momma Bosco’s spring break party.
109) MAX
[pickup1] Who knew Momma Bosco was a Ghost Gone Wild?
110) SAM
[pickup1] Hey Max, why don’t you hop in there and see where it leads?
111) MAX
[pickup1] [sarcastic] Yeah, sure. Crawl through a narrow tunnel to nowhere filled with Harry Moleman spoor. GREAT idea.
112) SAM
[pickup1] [context: looking at painting] Ah, one of Jan Hooksforhaans’ rare portraits.
113) SAM
[pickup1] He took so long to finish a painting, his subjects often died while posing.
114) SAM
[pickup1] Can’t tell from half a receipt, little buddy. If only we had some way to piece all these clues together...
115) SAM
[pickup1] [context: looking at a wardrobe] Hmm, wonder what’s in here?
116) MAX
[pickup1] Don’t open it, Sam! It probably leads to a fantastic land of wonder and thinly-disguised religious allegory.
117) SAM
[pickup1] Good call, Max. We already wasted enough time poking around that tollbooth.
118) SAM
[pickup1] Hello, operator?
119) SAM
[pickup1] Oops, sorry!
120) SAM
[pickup1] You know how those spirits are once they get talking about “the good old days” when they were alive. I guess we can’t make outgoing calls.
121) SAM
[pickup1] Nah, she probably didn’t need this thing anyway.
122) MAX
[pickup1] If she wanted it so bad, she should’ve taken better care of it.
123) SAM
[pickup1] I think this demon broth only brings people back to life if they’ve still got their body. Or at least, part of it.
124) MAX
[pickup1] Either way, it’s pretty impressive.
125) SAM
[pickup1] I can’t tell if that’s something Momma Bosco invented, or an award Momma Bosco got for inventing something.

{confused}So you’re suggesting we trap Skunkape in our own building?
132) MOMMABOSCO
Well, kind of. {proud}You’d actually be turning your building into an alternate dimension, {sarcastic}so it won’t really exist anymore.
