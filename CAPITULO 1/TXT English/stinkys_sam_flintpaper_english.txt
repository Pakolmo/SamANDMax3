1) FLINT
{happy}Hiya, furry pals!
2) SAM
Hey, it’s Flint Paper!
3) MAX
{happy}Maybe Flint can help us with our case, Sam!
4) FLINT
Any time, fellas! {normal}Except now. {happy}Would you look at that, Stinky’s prize-winning spaghetti! A private dick’s gotta eat, you know.
5) FLINT
{disgusted}Gimme a break, Sam. I haven’t eaten a thing since that yak’s blood on my Himalayan caper. And some gummy worms. {normal}Come back when I’m done eating, would ya?
6) SAM
{confused}Do you know anything about a missing power core, Flint?
7) SAM
{confused}Any idea when you’ll be done eating, Flint?
8) FLINT
{worried}Heck, I don’t know, Sam. Some time in the future, all right?
9) FLINT
{angry}It’d be a lot sooner if ya stop asking me, {normal}okay, champ?
10) MAX
{confused}How about now?
11) FLINT
{happy}What’s the word, pals?
12) SAM
See ya, Flint.
13) FLINT
{disgusted}Hey, do my eyes look puffy to you guys?
14) FLINT
I think I better go see Doris. {normal}She’s my allergy specialist. Man, is she gonna blow her stack when she hears about those peanuts...
15) MAX
Always.
16) SAM
{confused}Do you know anything about a power core?
17) FLINT
Yeah, Momma Bosco hired me to find it. {arrogant}Standard issue “Find the secret invention for the scientist before it falls into the wrong hands” stuff. {normal}Even you guys could do it! Err, no offense.
18) SAM
{sarcastic}Oh, yeah. We totally know where it is.
19) MAX
{aloof}We were just testing you.
20) FLINT
{arrogant}But I’m in the middle of a case that’s {angry}one hell of a lot bigger!
21) MAX
{sarcastic}They serve so many different kinds of toxins here, they’ve got their own menu.
22) SAM
Don’t be too hard on Stinky for almost poisoning you. {sarcastic}I’m sure it was an honest mistake.
23) FLINT
Nice try, fellas, {worried}but she’s on to me. I know it. I’m getting too close on this big case of mine, {angry}and she’s trying to rub me out!
24) SAM
{confused}What’s this big case you’re working on?
25) FLINT
{arrogant}Right, some crazy story you’d have to be an idiot to believe!
26) FLINT
Get ready to have your {angry}furry minds blown, pals, because this one goes WAY back. {normal}Think about it: what do we REALLY know about this Stinky doll?
27) MAX
{incredulous}[deflated] Right. Idiot.
28) FLINT
So I started digging around, and I found THIS out back.
29) SAM
[reading] “Stinky my queen, I cannot wait any longer. I will be making my grand appearance this afternoon. You say they won’t trust me because I’m not human, but damn the consequences! We must start phase 2 of the operation NOW. I will call your private number with the details. Love, S.”
30) FLINT
{normal}An inhuman monster, {disgusted}in bed with Stinky, planning something big this afternoon, {normal}name starts with S. {arrogant}You know what that means.
31) SAM
{surprised}Skunkape!
44) 
Skunkape
32) FLINT
{disgusted}Oh. Well, yeah, that could be it. {worried}I was thinking it was you, Sam!
33) MAX
{incredulous}[scolding] You think you know a guy. {aloof}I’m not angry, Sam, just very disappointed.
34) SAM
[reading] “P.S. Just to make sure... your private number is still 212-555-8942, isn’t it?”
35) FLINT
{happy}Good luck, fellas. I’ll let you know if I find anything else!
36) FLINT
Just that he tried to hire me to find some missing toys for him. {worried}I’m too busy with my other case, so I said nothing doing.
37) SAM
{confused}What do you know about this creep General Skunkape?
38) MAX
{worried}I can’t lie to Flint Paper, Sam!
39) FLINT
{normal}You wouldn’t know anything about these toys, would you?
40) SAM
{normal}I can, little buddy. {sarcastic}[to Flint]Nope, not a thing.
41) 
Stinky
42) 
Power core
43) 
Big case
45) 
Bye
46) SAM
[pickup1] Well, the story is that Grandpa Stinky actually created her using some kind of demonic spell, and she’s been running the diner ever since.
47) MAX
[pickup1] Sam, I may be psychic now, but I’ve got no idea how we’re going to find out Stinky’s private phone number.
48) SAM
[pickup1] [context: don’t be silly!] Come on, Max. If Stinky’s in cahoots with General Skunkape, it may have something to do with that missing power core.
