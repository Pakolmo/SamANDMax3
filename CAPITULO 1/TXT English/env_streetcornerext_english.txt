{surprised} It’s Stinky’s cell phone! {confused} But why would she have left it behind?
2) MAX
{sarcastic} Especially since she’s got 18 months left on her contract!
3) SAM
{suspicious} Either there was some kind of struggle, {realizing} or it was left here for us to find, {surprised} and we’re walking right into a trap!
4) MAX
[eureka moment] {realizing} I’ve got it! She waived her early cancellation fees with a {happy} recommended device upgrade!
5) SAM
{suspicious} So now we know two things: you’re an idiot, {enthused} and this phone is going to lead us directly to General Skunkape! Somehow...
6) MAX
Don’t beat yourself up, Sam. {sarcastic}We can knock it over when we come back.
7) SAM
We must’ve driven around this corner a million times, and I never noticed that fire hydrant before.
8) SAM
These buildings are all closed in observance of Skunkape Appreciation Day. Skunkape must’ve gone somewhere else.

[pickup1] {angry} I don’t have time for your shenanigans.
12) SAM
[pickup1][reading] Hmmm. You wouldn’t expect a fire hydrant to have so much kerosene...
13) MAX
[pickup1] [context: ...but I would] Maybe YOU wouldn’t.
14) SAM
[pickup1] It’s empty. Well, not EMPTY empty, but empty of anything useful.
15) SAM
[pickup1] I wonder what’s in that dumpster.
16) MAX
[pickup1] Sam, if you want me to dive into that dumpster, just ask. Don’t go all passive-aggressive on me.
17) MAX
[pickup1] Hikeebaaaaa!
18) MAX
[pickup1][process - inside dumpster] Hotchy motchy!
19) SAM
[pickup1] Max! Are you okay!?
20) MAX
[pickup1][calm] I’m fine, Sam. In fact, I seem to have acquired the ability to scan the ingredients of foods, people, and arbitrarily selected items.
21) SAM
[pickup1] Keen.
22) SAM
[pickup1] What’d you find, you filthy wretch?
23) MAX
[pickup1] I give you... THE NUTRI-SPECS!
24) SAM
[pickup1] Nutri-Specs? What do they do?
25) MAX
[pickup1] Only one way to find out!
26) MAX
[pickup1][Acquiring a new psychic power] Wubbiduwubbiduwubbidu!
27) MAX
[pickup1] Oh, Sam, you should really cut down on the seal jerky. Your phosphate levels are through the roof!
28) SAM
[pickup1] That’s a swell power, Max. Who knows what other sorts of amusing and quasi-useful information we’ll glean from those Nutri-Specs.
29) MAX
[pickup1] “Glean”? This isn’t France, Sam.
30) SAM
[pickup1] Nah, sounds like they’re planning a big gang-related shootout or illegal organ trade in there. I don’t want to bother them.
31) SAM
[pickup1] It’s empty. Why use a trash can when the pavement will do?
32) MAX
[pickup1] What’s in there?
33) SAM
[pickup1] As far as I can tell, a bunch of temp workers who’ve never seen a six-foot-tall dog peeking in their window before.
