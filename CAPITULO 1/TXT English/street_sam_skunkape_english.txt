1) SAM
All right, we’ll, uh, {incredulous} let you know if we find that artifact.
2) SUPERBALL
{stern} After clearing it through the Department of Homeworld Security first. Just a formality.
3) SKUNKAPE
[friendly] {happy} Go in peace!
4) SAM
{sarcastic} We’re done talking now!
5) SAM
{suspicious} What’s this about an “artifact”?
6) SKUNKAPE
[reverent] {proud} It is the Eyes of Yog-Soggoth, one of hundreds of magical toys {happy} scattered throughout the {proud} galaxy by the Great Comet!
7) SUPERBALL
{proud} It’s believed to give the holder the power to see the future.
8) MAX
{surprised} What a coincidence! I was just... [interrupted by Sam]
9) SAM
[interrupting] {happy} He was just saying how he WISHED he could see the future, so... {sarcastic}he and I would stop showing up to work wearing the same thing.
10) MAX
{incredulous} It gets pretty awkward.
11) SAM
{enthused} So, about this artifact...
12) SKUNKAPE
[eager] {proud} YES! You have found it?!
13) SAM
[quickly, causally] {sarcastic} Not as far as you know, {suspicious} but just for fun: why is it so important to you?
14) SKUNKAPE
[increasingly manic] {happy} It’s a legendary treasure! Said to give the wielder the power to predict his enemy’s every movement, {angry} manipulate the economies and governments of weaker worlds, avoid death, find complex solutions to puzzles using unconventional combinations of everyday items, {evil}and CRUSH ANYONE WHO STANDS IN HIS WAY!
15) SKUNKAPE
[quickly recovering] {cocky} But, ha ha, that’s all just a myth. I would simply... {confused}give it away. To my nephew. In Canada.
16) SAM
{confused} Any luck finding that artifact?
74) SAM
{confused} Any luck finding that artifact?
17) SKUNKAPE
{evil} No, but my best minion—{surprised}err, {cocky}research assistants are on the case. Have you seen it?
18) SAM
{sarcastic} Err, no. {happy}But I’ve got my best Max on the case.
19) SAM
{suspicious} You’re not from around here, are you?
20) SKUNKAPE
[good-natured] {happy} Guilty! {cocky} You could tell by the accent, right? {proud} No, I have traveled from a planet hundreds of light years away from your own.
21) SKUNKAPE
It was once a beautiful, swampy and muggy world, the air dancing with swarms of mosquitoes, the stillness of the nights punctuated only by the mewling of infants and the drunken revelries of toothless secessionists.
22) SKUNKAPE
{cocky} Its name would be impossible for your Earth tongues to pronounce, but my people know it as {happy}“Pensacola.”
23) SAM
{suspicious} So you’re planning to just find your magic toy and leave the planet peacefully, right?
24) SUPERBALL
{proud} The Earth’s Chamber of Commerce has a selection of coupons for discounted dining and entertainment during your stay.
25) SKUNKAPE
{surprised} Find my toy and leave? {cocky} Of course not! HA HA HA HA HA!
26) SAM
[confidentially, to Max] {suspicious} Stay frosty, Max. This is the part where he loses it and rips his mask off or eats a live mouse or something.
27) MAX
[confidentially] {sarcastic} Roger that. {happy}I’ll get my video camera.
28) SKUNKAPE
{proud} I would never leave without sharing the technology of my world with your backward, but fascinating people!
29) SAM
{realizing} What are you doing here, Agent Superball?
30) SUPERBALL
{stern} As you know, sirs, when you {cocky} appointed me Secretary of the Posterior, {proud} that placed me in command of the Department of Homeworld Security.
31) SAM
{confused} I didn’t know we HAD one of those. Did you, Max?
32) MAX
{surprised} Heck if I know. {aloof}As soon as they gave me a button that shoots ballistic missiles and a hotline to Milla Jovovich, I lost interest in everything else.
33) SUPERBALL
{stern} Well, I investigate visitations from aliens, abductions, violations of the time stream, lost continents, myths & legends, that kind of thing.
34) SUPERBALL
{Stern} It’s currently hovering between candy apple and fire engine red, sir. {proud}I’ll keep you updated.
35) SAM
What’s the Homeworld Security threat level, Superball?
36) SAM
Just wondering: {sarcastic} how much do you pay for security on a ship like that?
37) SKUNKAPE
[context: What do you mean?] {confused} Security?
38) MAX
{happy} You know, laser grids, explosive time locks, that kind of thing.
39) SAM
{suspicious} We’re just curious.
40) SKUNKAPE
{cocky} Ha ha ha! My spaceship and the wonders aboard it are open to all the feeble people of Earth!
41) MAX
[whining] {sad} It’s no fun when they don’t put up a fight!
42) SKUNKAPE
{happy} Of course! The miracles of my technology are welcome to everyone! Especially to your planet’s mole people.
43) SAM
{incredulous} So... we can just walk right on your spaceship whenever we want?
44) SAM
{worried} Not to point fingers or anything, but {sarcastic} we couldn’t help noticing that disembodied alien brain floating in a jar on board your ship.
45) SKUNKAPE
[sadly, forlorn laugh] {surprised} Oh, it’s not for sale, {happy} my friends, ha hmm.
46) MAX
{incredulous} How much do you want for it?
47) SKUNKAPE
[lying]{worried}That brain is all that remains of my colleague... Gordon... {confused}Joe... hansen... son. He, uh, fought by my side for many years, {proud}and gave his life to find the great artifacts.
48) SKUNKAPE
{angry} He was a great warrior, he really had an eye for toys... {happy}and he was a good friend.
49) SAM
{incredulous} Any ideas how we can bring that brain back to life?
50) SKUNKAPE
{worried} No, there’s no hope for him, I’m afraid. I’ll have to find a replacement. {evil}[sinister laugh]Bwah ha ha ha ha.
51) MAX
[through clenched teeth] {surprised} This is making me uncomfortable.
52) SAM
{suspicious} What’s the story behind your whole mole man fixation?
53) SKUNKAPE
{happy} Ha ha ha, it’s no fixation! General Skun-ka’pe is a friend to {proud} ALL creatures of the galaxy, from the greatest ape to the tiniest, {cocky} most insignificant and pitiable mole man.
54) MAX
{happy} Hey, we KNOW the most insignificant and pitiable mole man!
55) SKUNKAPE
{cocky} On every planet I visit, all of the local mole people are invited to ride my fantastic gamma beam to a wonderful off-world vacation {evil} they’ll never forget!
56) SKUNKAPE
[quickly, like a disclaimer] {surprised} (I don’t kill them).
57) SAM
{confused} Where are these fabulous off-world vacations, exactly?
58) SKUNKAPE
{surprised} Why, {cocky}any planet you can imagine! {evil}Ha ha ha ha ha!
59) MAX
{happy} Pluto?
60) SAM
[scolding] {stern} That’s not a planet, Max.
61) MAX
{happy} The planet of nubile Amazon Priestesses bathing in rivers of chocolate and toffee?
62) SKUNKAPE
[lying] {confused} Um, sure. Why not?
63) SAM
{enthused} Does the general want a banana?
64) SKUNKAPE
{happy}I see. Because I resemble your Earth gorillas, you assume I want a banana. {cocky}I’m glad to see that Earthlings are still so charmingly racist.
65) SAM
{stern} Relax, buddy, we’re just making sure you’re getting enough potassium.
