1) SAM
Lock and load, Max!
2) NARRATOR
{stern} Friends, you have just participated in a troubling vision of the future... the first of many such disturbing revelations. {arrogant}Over the next five chapters, you will witness things that baffle you. Horrify you. Even disgust you.
3) NARRATOR
{surprised} BUT YOU MUST NOT LOOK AWAY! {stern} Pay close attention to everything that you see and hear!
4) NARRATOR
Because when our story reaches its bowel-tingling climax, only YOU, my friends, will possess the ability to save the entire universe!
5) MAX
{confused} Uh, wait... which one of us is “the fuzzy one”?
6) NARRATOR
It’s a familiar tale: a power-mad space gorilla pitted against a canine detective and a sociopathic bunny with psychic powers.
7) NARRATOR
[opening VO] In all the universe... the only power beyond the mind’s comprehension... is the power to comprehend the power of the mind.
8) MAX
{realizing} You know, Sam, Skunkape may be a tool, {sarcastic} but he brings a refreshingly childlike glee to his work.
9) SAM
{sarcastic} Yeah, Max. It’s hard to stay mad at the guy.
10) NARRATOR
[opening VO] If any one of us could unlock this terrible power, would we use it to explore the mysteries of the infinite? Or would we use it... to destroy?
11) SKUNKAPE
{evil} Yes! YES! Tremble, Earthlings! Tremble before the might of General Skun-ka’pe! HA ha ha ha ha!
12) SAM
[disappointed] {angry} Totally ruined the moment.
13) NARRATOR
But, my friends, this story is different. In this story, YOU are in control.
14) MAX
Hey, Sam! It’s our new pal, the disembodied alien brain!
219) MAX
Hey, Sam! It’s our new pal, the disembodied alien brain!
15) ALIENBRAIN
The same. I am speaking to you telepathically. No one else can hear me, Sam & Max!
220) ALIENBRAIN
The same. I am speaking to you telepathically. No one else can hear me, Sam & Max!
16) STINKY
[context: “no one else can hear me”] I can.
221) STINKY
[context: “no one else can hear me”] I can.
17) ALIENBRAIN
Did you really believe it would be that easy?
18) MAX
{aloof} Kinda, yeah.
19) SKUNKAPE
[context: “did I just hear something?”] {surprised} Eh?
20) ALIENBRAIN
Uh, hang on. [grunting]Errrgghh... there we go.
21) SAM
It’s a lump of Rhinoplasty, the wacky modeling clay that promises hours of fun!
22) MAX
{sarcastic} And delivers about five to ten minutes’ worth!
23) SAM
It’s an ordinary deck of playing cards.
24) MAX
{Stern} OR IS IT?!
25) SAM
[grossed out] Eww.
26) MAX
{happy} Only you could take something as beautiful and natural as telepathy {suspicious} and make it sound wrong.
27) SKUNKAPE
[context: “Did I hear something?”] Hmmm?
28) SKUNKAPE
Oh. A... plant. [insincere]I love what you’ve done with the place, my queen.
29) MAX
Now what?
30) SAM
Now we just use the remote control Momma Bosco gave us, and Skunkape gets sucked right in the Penal Zone!
31) SAM
So to speak.
32) SKUNKAPE
Ha ha ha! Well done, Sam & Max! But I’m far too strong to be captured again! Soon this gateway will close, and there will be nothing to stop me!
33) MAX
Okay! That’s enough of that.
34) ALIENBRAIN
That won’t work, Max. It must be a picture of an inanimate object!
35) MAX
Okay, fine. {aloof}It was just an idea.
36) ALIENBRAIN
[process echo/mind-reading] I know what you’re doing, Max. Cut it out.
37) STINKY
[process echo/mind-reading] {seatedthrone} ...Mustn’t find out... I wonder if they suspect anything? What is he doing? Is he reading my mind right now? [blocking her thoughts] La-la-la-la-la.
38) SKUNKAPE
[process echo/mind-reading] {cocky} Stay strong, Skun-ka’pe! {worried} Never let them know you’re crying inside.
39) SAM
[process echo/mind-reading] [singing] {happy} Let’s all go for a ride... in my magical balloon...
40) SAM
[process echo/mind-reading] {confused} No, no. Fudge nuggets! {stern}THOSE are my favorite. {happy}THEN pork fruit jerky strips.
41) SAM
[process echo/mind-reading] {confused} Wonder if I should remind Max to get Harry Moleman’s phone number. {incredulous}Nah, he’ll feel better if he figures it out himself.
42) MAX
Hey, get a load of me! I’m pollinating!
43) SAM
[context: getting his attention, then “Scarface”] {angry} Hey, Skunkape! Say hello to my little buddy!
44) MAX
Careful with that trigger finger, Sam.
45) SAM
{enthused} Good work, Max! Now let’s...
46) MAX
[overwhelmed] I’m a bazooka, Sam, a BAZOOKA! Oh, just give me a moment to savor this. Ohhh, yes!
47) SAM
It’s locked. We’ll have to find another way to get upstairs.
48) SAM
It’s locked.
49) SAM
[worried] I don’t know!
50) MAX
What do we do now, Sam?
51) MAX
{cocky} Don’t sweat it, Sam. I’ve got psychic powers!
52) SAM
If I open the Penal Zone before I get rid of this homing beacon, I’LL get sucked in!
53) SAM
The gateway’s already open.
54) SAM
Nothing in there but fear and death and time-wasting.
55) MAX
And sweat! {suspicious} Don’t forget the sweat.
56) SAM
Nothing interesting in there.
57) CONSTRUCTIONWORKER
{cocky} Step aside, ladies. Big winner comin’ through!
58) COMPUTERVOICE
Congratulations!
59) SAM
Hey, pal, we want to ask you—
60) CONSTRUCTIONWORKER
I been listenin’ to suits like you for too long already. You can dig your own tunnels now, whiles I enjoy an all expenses paid off-world vacation! So long, suckers!
61) COMPUTERVOICE
We’re sorry. Our fabulous off-world vacations are for mole men only.
62) SAM
Hey, brain, can you open this door for us?
63) SAM
{suspicious} Official business.
64) ALIENBRAIN
Odd, you don’t look Molish.
65) COMPUTERVOICE
Welcome.
66) SKUNKAPE
Witness, Sam & Max!
67) CONSTRUCTIONWORKER
[process muffled, behind door] Squeeeak!
68) ALIENBRAIN
Besides, it’s for mole people only.
69) MAX
{happy} Perfect! We’re part mole man!
70) SAM
{Sarcastic} By marriage.
71) ALIENBRAIN
Very well, I will try...
72) ALIENBRAIN
You did it, Sam & Max! You awakened me from the sleep of one hundred deaths!
73) SAM
Well, that’s encouraging.
74) MAX
{confused} So, uh... how DID we do it?
75) SAM
{confused} I dunno, we haven’t done it yet.
76) ALIENBRAIN
How did you do it?
77) SAM
{realizing} I know! What if you use that future vision on ME?
78) SAM
{enthused} Easy-peasy! All it took was Stinky’s demon broth, and Momma Bosco’s futuristic power core!
79) MAX
{incredulous} Don’t forget the jumper cables, Sam. They were very important.
80) ALIENBRAIN
Whatever the case, listen carefully: do not trust General Skun-ka’pe! He is... he is... oh... something’s happening...
81) SAM
{stern} That won’t work until we get a power supply.
82) SAM
This should give that brain the jolt he needs to face the morning!
83) SAM
{realizing} Now we just need some way to hook it up.
84) MAX
[to the brain] Mmm, it’s too bad you don’t have a nose, {happy} ‘cause you smell DELICIOUS!
85) SAM
[matter-of-factly] Well, that’s ominous.
86) SAM
[reading] “Fabulous Off-World Vacation Departure Center.”
87) SAM
[reading] “Mole Man Processing.”
88) SKUNKAPE
{cocky} Ha ha ha! Engines to full power! {happy} YES! Destroy the city!
89) NARRATOR
{arrogant} Look familiar? {stern} I certainly hope that you were paying attention, my friends, because our story seems to have hurtled to its inevitable conclusion.
90) NARRATOR
{arrogant} No longer can you blindly mash buttons to unleash a torrent of irreverent banter and comic mischief. Now, {surprised} YOU {stern} are all that stands in the way of the total annihilation of the planet Earth!
91) NARRATOR
{arrogant} The villain has made his move. The players are yours to command. Only {stern} YOU can return General Skun-ka’pe to... the Penal Zone.
92) MAX
*snicker* {happy} Penal Zone.
93) SAM
{happy} Tee hee.
94) MAX
That won’t do any good. Stinky’s right here with us!
95) ALIENBRAIN
Well done, Freelance Police! Now, you must place the homing beacon on Skunkape’s back to trap him in... the Penal Zone!
96) SAM
[context: “We’re on the case!”] {enthused} We’re on it!
97) MAX
{cocky} Now light up those toys!
98) MAX
{confused}...The hell?
99) SKUNKAPE
{evil} Looking for these?
100) SAM
{surprised} Uh-oh.
322) SAM
{surprised} Uh-oh.
101) MAX
{scared} So... what was our “Plan B” again?
102) SKUNKAPE
{cocky} I believe you planned to turn on the dimensional destabilizer, yes? Luckily, I have my own.
103) SAM
{confused} But I’ve still got the homing beacon!
104) SKUNKAPE
{proud} Exactly. Ha ha ha ha ha!
105) SKUNKAPE
{proud} Did you see that, my Queen? Not only did I defeat Sam & Max, but I took care of the Penal Zone in one stroke!
106) MAX
{aloof} Unfortunate word choice.
107) ALIENBRAIN
Sam & Max, you survived! Have you returned with a... how do I put this tactfully... better thought-out plan to stop Skun-ka’pe?
108) SAM
[offended] {stern} Hey, our last plan would’ve worked fine if he hadn’t changed the future!
109) MAX
{cocky} Yeah! {aloof}How do I put this tactfully... {angry}hmm... bite me.
110) ALIENBRAIN
You’ll need to get your personal belongings... let me see if I can... nngggghhh. OH, that hurts! Does everyone else taste butterscotch?
111) SAM
{enthused} Thanks, brain! Now we just need a way to get this homing beacon on Skunkape’s back without his noticing.
112) SAM
Hey brain, any way you can open this door?
113) ALIENBRAIN
I am growing weak, but I will try... nnnggggrrrggghhhh!
114) ALIENBRAIN
[pained] Oowww, that did NOT feel right. [realizing]Oh, great, and now I can’t remember how to multiply by 6. Just perfect.
115) ALIENBRAIN
I can’t remember the name of my elementary school.
116) SKUNKAPE
[heard something] {surprised} Hmm...?
273) SKUNKAPE
[heard something] {surprised} Hmm...?
117) STINKY
[bored, annoyed] {seatedthrone} What? Don’t you have planets to blow up or something?
118) SAM
[quietly] Thanks, Stinky! [calling out] Hey, brain! Can you give us a hand here?
119) ALIENBRAIN
I grow weak, Jam & Tracks, and I fear my time in this wharf is drawing to a clone. But if I can prevent but one villain from massaging another appointment book, my sacrifice is but a small, small bacon melt to pay.
120) MAX
{aloof} Great. Could you hurry it up?
121) SAM
[scolding]{stern} Max, show some respect for this noble creature’s sacrifice. [to the brain]{worried}Could you hurry it up, PLEASE?
122) ALIENBRAIN
Donut button, Sam & Max! Donut button til we meet again in the plaid! Nggggghhhhhhh...
123) COMPUTERVOICE
Emergency. Engine failure. Emergency.
124) MAX
Maybe cause a subtle yet stylish distraction?
125) SKUNKAPE
{surprised} No! NO! {angry} Not in my moment of triumph!
126) SAM
[quietly] That’s it, little buddy! Let’s go!
127) SKUNKAPE
{angry} Sam & Max must somehow be responsible for this! I must find them! {evil} AND DESTROY THEM!
128) SKUNKAPE
Ha ha ha ha ha!
146) MAXSKELETON
[process scary demonic laugh] HA HA HA HA HA!
129) SKUNKAPE
Full power to right mandible! YES!
130) SKUNKAPE
Take THAT!
131) SKUNKAPE
Die, Earthlings! DIE!
132) ALIENBRAIN
[process: echo on “teleportation”] Max, this unassuming telephone unlocks the gift of TELEPORTATION.
133) ALIENBRAIN
Using the power of your mind, you can teleport yourself to any phone number you have memorized.
134) MAX
{happy} Oh boy! I want to try it RIGHT NOW!
135) SAM
{worried} We can’t jump out; we’re in mid-air!
136) ALIENBRAIN
[disappointed] Aren’t you going to try the teleportation power?
226) ALIENBRAIN
[disappointed] Aren’t you going to try the teleportation power?
137) MAX
{aloof} Sure, we’ll try it out later!
302) MAX
{aloof} Sure, we’ll try it out later!
138) ALIENBRAIN
[really disappointed] Oh. Okay. *Sigh*
303) ALIENBRAIN
[really disappointed] Oh. Okay. *Sigh*
139) SAM
{worried} Is everything okay, brain?
304) SAM
{worried} Is everything okay, brain?
140) ALIENBRAIN
[forlorn] It’s just... I’ve never seen it. I’m just a brain in a jar, can’t really use it. It sounded cool, is all.
305) ALIENBRAIN
[forlorn] It’s just... I’ve never seen it. I’m just a brain in a jar, can’t really use it. It sounded cool, is all.
141) MAX
[annoyed] {aloof} Okay, fine, we’ll do it now.
306) MAX
[annoyed] {aloof} Okay, fine, we’ll do it now.
142) MAX
Hey, Sam, I got Harry Moleman’s phone number!
143) SAM
Nice work, little buddy! Make sure you wait three days to call, or he’ll think you’re desperate.
144) NARRATOR
Well done, my friends. Now select a phone number that Max has memorized to teleport himself, and his furry longtime companion, to that location. And also Sam.
145) MAXSKELETON
[process scary demonic voice] ENJOYING THE RIDE, SAM?
147) SAM
{worried} Note to self: when traveling through Max’s brain, keep your eyes SHUT.
148) SKUNKAPE
[angry] {evil} Gordon’s ALIVE? [recovering, friendly] {happy} I mean, what a pleasant surprise! Tell me, friend brain, where is the toy?
149) ALIENBRAIN
I can’t help it! I’m... [chanting]Oooommmmmm... Yog-Soggoth nagul oram! Yog-Soggoth nagul oram!
150) ALIENBRAIN
[dying] Two... toys... too weak... can’t trace... aaahhh.
151) SAM
[panic] {worried} What are you doing, brain? Cut it out!
152) COMPUTERVOICE
Toys detected. Toys detected.
153) ALIENBRAIN
[checking for coast is clear] Is he gone?
154) SAM
{normal} Yeah, the coast is clear. {confused}What just happened?
155) SUPERBALL
Spaceship is secure. If I could have a moment, sirs.
156) SKUNKAPE
[outraged] {evil} Curses! {angry} Very well, I’ll find them myself!
157) ALIENBRAIN
I don’t know, I’ve never felt anything like that! The toys of this planet must have astonishing power!
158) SAM
I can’t just wander around, or Skunkape will see me!
159) SAM
I can’t leave before I plant this homing beacon on Skunkape!
160) SAM
There’ll be time for wandering around AFTER we finish Skunkape, Max!
161) MAX
I’ve achieved my life’s goal of becoming a bazooka. No WAY am I turning back now!
162) MAX
Hey Sam, in the future all the cool stuff is upstairs. So why are we still down here?
163) MAX
Sam, {confused} where do you think that mole man went?
164) SAM
{worried} Well, uh... {sad}I’m sure he went off to a nice big farm upstate where he can run and jump and dig through the fields all he wants.
165) MAX
Oh... well, if he isn’t coming back, can I have all of his stuff?
166) SAM
[a little annoyed] {stern} I don’t like the thought of you teleporting off without me, Max.
167) ALIENBRAIN
You can go, too, Sam! Max will teleport anyone he’s touching!
168) MAX
[warning Sam] {incredulous} Watch the hands.
169) MAX
{suspicious} And THAT is why we’re doing a staycation this year.
170) MAX
[scandalous] {suspicious} There were rituals!
171) STINKY
[bored, sarcastic] Hooray, it’s the Freelance Police.
172) SKUNKAPE
{cocky} Your future viewer has proven to be most... {evil}enlightening. Ha ha ha ha! {proud}Here, use it to witness how I am going to destroy you!
173) SAM
{suspicious} This place looks eerily familiar. {realizing}Check it out, Max: the control center for invaders from distant stars!
174) MAX
[impatient] {aloof} Yeah, yeah. Alien spaceship. SEEN IT. {cocky}I just wanna get to the part where I have those sweet psychic powers!
175) SAM
{enthused}We just need our friend the brain to hook you up and... {surprised}Oh no! He’s dead!
176) MAX
{realizing} Didn’t he look more... {incredulous}moist in the future?
177) SAM
{worried} We’ve got to find some way to wake him up so he can explain what’s going on!
178) SAM
[loudly, like talking to hard-of-hearing] {realizing} Hey Harry, do you know how we can beat Skunkape?
179) SAM
[loudly, like talking to hard of hearing] Hey Harry, do you have a phone or something we can borrow?
284) SAM
[loudly, like talking to hard of hearing] Hey Harry, do you have a phone or something we can borrow?
180) SAM
{stern}Nothing. {worried}Are we SURE he’s not dead in there?
181) SAM
In a better world, aliens and Earthlings would be able to unite under our shared love of really cool guns.
182) SAM
We’d need more than just a PICTURE of a space bazooka to do any damage to somebody as big as Skunkape.
183) SAM
Looks like Skunkape is about three hundred thousand miles overdue for an oil and filter change.
184) SAM
I wish I could predict what I was about to do, ‘cause then I wouldn’t have to waste time trying to think of what it is.
185) MAX
This spaceship looks a lot bigger from the outside. Have we tried all the secret doors?
186) MAX
Why aren’t we out looking for clues instead of hanging out in the one place we know Skunkape ISN’T?
187) SAM
Nothing.
188) SAM
{suspicious}Weird, there’s a hard hat and... {realizing}some kind of vacation ticket.
189) COMPUTERVOICE
All the personal effects confiscated from our fuel resources are collected and donated to various intergalactic mole man charities.
190) MAX
{happy} What a nice gesture! We should leave it for when that mole man gets back, Sam.
191) SAM
{worried} I think he, uh... went to live on a farm to play with other mole men.
192) MAX
{realizing}Ohhhh. {devilish}Check if he left his wallet.
193) SAM
{stern} No such luck.
194) SAM
{surprised} Hey, it’s all my stuff!
195) SAM
Looks like Grandpa Stinky’s stuff got mixed in with all of mine.
196) MAX
What has he got in his pocketses?
197) SAM
His victory badge from Skunkape, and... [excited]{happy}jackpot! A collectible shot glass from Meesta Pizza!
198) SAM
[disdain] Give a gorilla a cool, heavily-armed spaceship and all of a sudden he thinks he owns the galaxy.
199) SAM
It’s too bad Skunkape decided to go into galaxy domination. He’s got a real eye for interior decorating.

[pickup1] {cocky} We can’t leave the spaceship now! There’s still so much ape-thwarting to do!
222) SAM
[pickup1] {incredulous} We’re gonna need some kind of cover to get up close and personal with Skunkape.
223) SAM
[pickup1] {sad} Poor Harry. General Skunkape put him in this penny conscious terrarium to make an example out of him.
224) SAM
[pickup1] {suspicious} Skunkape’s got him under a super-powered sunlamp. {worried}It’s horrible.

233) MAX
[pickup1] [under his breath] So what’s he gonna do, punch me? No hands!
234) SAM
[pickup1] [to his gun] Oh, baby, I’ve missed you.
235) MAX
[pickup1] I can’t wait to get my stinking paws on that damn dirty ape!

241) SAM
Try to look leafy and inconspicuous, Max.
242) MAX
I always do.
243) SAM
[pickup1] Your Nutri-Specs indicate that, aside from the expected levels of snark, coffee ice cream, tar, and fish sticks, Girl Stinky is chock full of... love!

245) SAM
[pickup1] Yikes!
246) MAX
[pickup1] You must be reading that thing wrong.
247) SAM
[pickup1][reading] Hmmm. Maybe we don’t have to defeat Skunkape after all. If your Nutri-Specs are right, he’ll keel over from mercury poisoning in a few years anyway.

[pickup1] Maybe he should run for Congress!
254) SAM
[pickup1][reading] 50 percent alien protein, 40 percent chicken stock, 3 percent jackalope eyes... That’ll get the cortexes firing on all cylinders.

[pickup3] You are now inside the dankest recesses of Max’s mind, where you can attempt to control his horrible psychic abilities, unlocked by the Toys of Power.
274) ALIENBRAIN
[pickup3] [quickly, dismissively] Shut up. [to Sam & Max]Your Earth weapons will never be enough to defeat General Skun-ka’pe. Don’t you still have that homing beacon?
275) ALIENBRAIN
Perfect! Now you must place the homing beacon on General Skun-ka’pe’s back to trap him in... [dramatically]THE PENAL ZONE!
276) ALIENBRAIN
[pickup3] Max, remember that you have been blessed with the Gift! You must unlock your abilities with the remaining Toys of Power!
277) ALIENBRAIN
[pickup3] Max, the Rhinoplasty will grant you the incredible power of shapeshifting!
278) ALIENBRAIN
[pickup3] You can use the Rhinoplasty to pick up a picture of any inanimate object. Then, use the power of your mind to transform into that object! It’s fun!
279) ALIENBRAIN
[pickup3] Max, the playing cards have granted you the power to thrust your consciousness into the fleshy minds of others and pluck out their most intimate thoughts!
280) ALIENBRAIN
[pickup3] Well done, Freelance Police! Now, you must get that homing beacon onto General Skun-ka’pe before he reaches the Bronx, or all will be lost!
281) ALIENBRAIN
[pickup3] Before he was imprisoned, your friend the moleman was screaming something about taking over the ship. Find out what he knows!
282) ALIENBRAIN
[pickup3] Hmm, I can’t open the doors now, but I have an idea!
283) ALIENBRAIN
[pickup3] With all the flashing lights and panels up here, there must be something that can help.
285) ALIENBRAIN
[pickup3] Even if he could hear you through the glass, Sam, the sunlamp has made him even more worthless than usual.
286) ALIENBRAIN
[pickup3] Max, you’ll have to use another one of the Toys of Power!
287) ALIENBRAIN
[pickup3] Excellent, Max! That phone number might be enough, because General Skun-ka’pe locked the mole man’s cell phone and other belongings inside this container.
288) SAM
[pickup3] Good job, Max. Now there must be something here that’ll help us knock Skunkape back into the Penal Zone.
289) 
alien brain
290) SAM
[pickup3] We’ve got to find some way to bring him back to life, so he can explain what’s going on!
291) ALIENBRAIN
[pickup3] You want to go into the mole processing room? But it’s a horrible place!
292) SAM
Well you heard the me, little buddy. We’ve gotta find some demon broth and Momma Bosco’s futuristic power core!
293) SAM
Nope, don’t think so.
295) SAM
{confused} Where is Skunkape’s collection of magic toys?
296) ALIENBRAIN
He keeps them on display as a show of power. I’m regaining control over the ship’s functions, so I can reveal them to you. BEHOLD!
297) MAX
{confused} That’s it?
298) ALIENBRAIN
“That’s it”? It’s a toy that lets you teleport across vast distances in the blink of an eye using only the power of your mind! That’s not cool enough for you?
299) SAM
{confused} It’s just... we saw more toys in Max’s vision.
300) ALIENBRAIN
More toys? You must not have found them yet! They must still be somewhere in this city!
301) ALIENBRAIN
You have to find them before Skun-ka’pe does, or he’ll destroy us all!

[pickup1] Hmm, that’s down ten percent from last season.
332) SAM
[pickup1] Agent Superball is comprised of 20 percent mystery and 80 percent sheer awesome.
333) SAM
[pickup1] Let’s see what’s in Grandpa Stinky’s mysterious demon broth...
334) SAM
[pickup1][reading] Celery... chicken stock... carrots...
335) MAX
[pickup1] BORing!
336) SAM
[pickup1] [reading, continuing] Finely ground cherub bones... minced albino buffalo tongues...
337) MAX
[pickup1][impatient] What is this, a demon broth or a kindergarten pot luck? Where’s the EVIL?
338) SAM
[pickup1] Ah, here we go... 2 percent aspartame.
339) MAX
[pickup1] The fiend!
