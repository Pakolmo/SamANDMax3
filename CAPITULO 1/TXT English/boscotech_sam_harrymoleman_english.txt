1) HARRY
[ominous] I’m sensing... {happy}that you want to ask me some questions!
2) HARRY
[ominous] I know all and see all!
3) SAM
But you don’t know anything about science!
4) MAX
{happy}Or hygiene!
5) HARRY
{happy}She says I’m perfect for the job!
6) HARRY
{normal}Which means I’ll never go mad and take over the lab for my own twisted experiments!{happy} I’m perfect!
7) MOMMABOSCO
I never hired him.
8) SAM
{confused}What are you doing here, Harry?
9) HARRY
I’m working as Momma Bosco’s lab assistant!
10) SAM
{confused}Are you sure that you’re, uh, {sarcastic}compatible with Momma Bosco?
11) MOMMABOSCO
{stern}Only you can see me, huh? How many fingers am I holding up?
12) HARRY
{happy}Only one! [to Sam & Max] HA! See? I... {embarrassed}[realizing he’s been insulted]Oh.
13) SAM
{incredulous}You know, Harry, we can all see and hear Momma Bosco.
14) HARRY
That’s just a manifestation of the unconscious... [dejected]{sad}oh, who am I kidding? You’re right. {embarrassed}I’m just useless.
15) MAX
{incredulous}[consoling] He’s right. {sarcastic}You’re TOTALLY useless.
16) SAM
{worried}Come on, Harry. You’re not “just useless.”
17) SAM
If you can talk to the dead, {confused}maybe you know about psychic powers?
18) MAX
{cocky}Sam’s worried about my brain because I can see the future now.
19) HARRY
Psychic powers? There’s no such thing. They just made that up to sell documentary TV series back in the 70s.
20) HARRY
{embarrassed}[as an afterthought] Unless they’re caused by a giant, deadly tumor.
21) MAX
{happy}See, Sam? There’s nothing to worry about.
22) HARRY
What mole man HASN’T heard about it? {happy}It’s the talk of the five burrows!
23) SAM
{enthused}Did you hear about General Skunkape’s fabulous off-world vacations?
24) MAX
{happy}Why don’t you go try it out?
25) HARRY
{embarrassed}[sad] I was at a job interview when they gave out the tickets. {sad}By the time I got back, it was already too late.
26) MAX
{sarcastic}I’ve got a really good feeling about your chances this time!
27) HARRY
{sad}Ah, the lottery’s just for unemployed losers who don’t understand how numbers work.
28) MAX
{confused}So how many tickets have you bought?
29) SAM
If money’s tight, {enthused}maybe you should try the lottery.
30) HARRY
{sad}[dejected] Twelve.{normal} No, wait... {embarrassed}one.
31) HARRY
That’s what I’m afraid of. {embarrassed}And ghosts.
32) MAX
{realizing}[encouraging] And cheer up! You’ll get what’s coming to you!
33) SAM
See you around, Harry.

[pickup1] Of course! I’ve been blessed with the unique ability to communicate with the recently deceased!
41) HARRY
[pickup1] Apparently there was some kind of power shake-up. I got laid off.
42) SAM
[pickup1] I thought you already had a job.
43) HARRY
[pickup1] [hopeful] You guys aren’t looking for another partner, are you?
44) SAM
[pickup1] We’ll, uh... keep your resume on file in case there’s an opening.
