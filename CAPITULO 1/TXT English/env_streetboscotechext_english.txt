3) SAM
It’s okay, sir. We’re close personal friends of Momma Bosco’s.
4) MINION1
We’re closed.
5) SAM
[friendly]{enthused} Hey, Space Gorilla. {confused}You’re kind of blocking the door there. {realizing}Mind if we scooch on by?
6) MAX
{worried}[context: unlike this one, ...] This sucks, Sam. The old Bosco’s NEVER closed.
7) SAM
I suspect Momma Bosco’s got something in there that General Skunkape doesn’t want us to find.
8) SAM
{worried}But my little buddy’s trapped inside!

{worried}But my little buddy’s trapped inside!
9) MAX
{confused} [accusingly] Really, Sam? That’s the best you’ve got for “use gun with gorilla”? {incredulous}It’s like I don’t even know you anymore.
10) SAM
{enthused}Hey buddy, I’ll give you this cool gun if you let us in the lab!
11) MINION1
{angry}Scram.
12) SAM
{surprised}Wow, those space gorillas are tough!
13) SAM
Well, that knocked him out cold!
14) MAX
{happy}Do it again! Do it again!
15) SAM
{worried}[terrified] Max, no! Stop! Heel!
16) MAX
{angry}[giant monster mode] Grrrwoooowl!
17) MAX
{realizing}An ominous shadow of our violent and destructive future? {happy}I can’t wait!
18) SAM
{confused}What was THAT all about?
19) MAX
{scared}[being choked] Arrggllggllrrrglll...
20) MINION1
[dropped from a great height] Oooof!
21) SAM
{enthused}[pleased with himself] Two in one blow! And without any significant injuries, either!
22) MAX
[hoarse] I think he crushed my trachea.
23) MINION1
{angry}Looks to me like we just did.
24) SAM
At least give me back my sidekick!
25) MINION1
{normal}You’ll get the rabbit once Jerome’s done workin’ him over.
26) SAM
{stern}Hey, you guys can’t do that to me!
27) SAM
Talking to that guy is a waste of time. I’ve got to figure out some better way to get the drop on him.
28) MAX
[being choked] Arrgglllgglll...
29) SAM
Max’s teleportation power is pretty cool; {suspicious}I just wish there weren’t so much inappropriate touching involved.
30) SAM
When I get stuck on a case like this, I miss my days as a circus acrobat. I’m not making that up.
31) SAM
{worried}Poor Max keeps getting strangled by that gorilla, and he can’t even call for help because I’ve got the phone!
32) SAM
{sarcastic}The name “Bosco” and science go together like church and state.
33) SAM
It’s kind of tacky, the way Momma Bosco hung that banner right out over the sidewalk.
34) SAM
They say that if you get up high enough, you can see the Liberal Elite headquarters hovering over Staten Island.
35) SAM
{enthused}Hello, lamp post! What ya knowin’?
36) SAM
{Stern}[offended] Sheesh, what a jerk.
37) SAM
I could climb this thing to get a better perspective on the situation, {confused}but I need to get higher.
38) SAM
Nah, I already took care of that before we left.
39) SAM
Oh, hi! I remember you from the reception.
40) SAM
This antenna is way too flimsy to support my weight.
41) SAM
Pretty cool! Not useful, though.

[pickup1] What the devil?
50) SAM
65 percent oxygen, 18 percent carbon, 10 percent hydrogen... Well, ain’t that a stitch! These alien gorillas share the same elemental composition as you and me!
51) MAX
[pickup1] Speak for yourself, Sam. I have wayyyyyy more bismuth than those stupid apes.
52) SAM
[pickup1][reading] Hmmm. You wouldn’t expect a fire hydrant to have so much kerosene...
53) MAX
[pickup1] [context: ...but I would] Maybe YOU wouldn’t.
54) MAX
[pickup1] [while being strangled] We’re... already... there...
55) SAM
[pickup1] Hey, NEXT time you go to Stinky’s, bring me back one of those salted banana nut logs, would you?
56) MAX
[pickup1] [sullen] Shut up.
57) MAX
[pickup1] That gorilla cut off the oxygen to my brain. I don’t even remember grade school.
58) SAM
[pickup1] Do you remember where we parked?
59) SAM
[pickup1] Cut out the tomfoolery, Max. We’ve got to get rid of that gorilla.
60) SAM
[pickup1] You went to Skunkape’s spaceship without me?
61) MAX
[pickup1] If you want to be the one who gets strangled from now on, go right ahead.
62) SAM
[pickup1] There must be something pretty important in Momma Bosco’s lab if Skunkape left his goons to guard the place.
63) SAM
[pickup1] All right, pigeon. Hand over the shiny thing and nobody has to get hurt.
81) SAM
[pickup1] All right, pigeon. Hand over the shiny thing and nobody has to get hurt.
64) SAM
[pickup1] Hey, careful where you drop that thing!

[pickup1] Hey, careful where you drop that thing!
65) SAM
[pickup1] It’s an engagement ring!
66) MAX
[pickup1] Sam, this is all so sudden! I... I don’t know what to say!
67) SAM
[pickup1] Quiet, bonehead.
68) SAM
[pickup1] Hmm, I’ve got a feeling Skunkape picked it up while he was out looking for toys.
69) SAM
[pickup1] Ahh, there’s an engraving: “Hard Luck.” Classy.
70) SAM
[pickup1] [context: cut off mid-proposal] Will you do me the honor of...?
71) SAM
[pickup1] Geez, buddy. You could’ve at least let me down easy.

Keep your tiny black eyes open, Max. Skunkape or one of his minions might have left a clue as to where they were going.

Nah.
