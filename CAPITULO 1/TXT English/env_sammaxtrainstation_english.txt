1) SAM
The mole people still haven’t cleared away all those old Mimesweeper cartridges.
2) MAX
{confused}Clear them away? They’re vintage collector’s items! {sarcastic}Mark my words, Sam: one day, those games are going to be worth PENNIES!
3) SAM
Well, we’ll never be able to get past them.
4) MAX
Well NOW I just want to know how we get over there!
5) SAM
Me, too. Knowing us, it’s probably something clever but overly complicated.
6) SAM
Beats me.
7) MAX
{confused}So... why did we come over here again?
8) MAX
{suspicious}And it’s still warm! {angry}Documentary filmmakers must be lurking nearby!
9) SAM
{enthused}Hey look! It’s Momma Bosco’s futuristic power core!
10) SAM
It’s a big pile of low-tech audio/video equipment, tossed out like pianos from a falling zeppelin.
11) SAM
{normal}That’s a mystery for another episode, Max.
12) MAX
{confused}What was it doing down here?
13) SAM
{worried}You keep coming up with creepy disaster scenarios that always end up with you eating me, Max. {stern}It’s getting annoying.
14) MAX
{suspicious}If you don’t like it, then stop looking so damn tasty.
15) MAX
{worried}[disappointed] Awww. I was hoping we’d teleport under an immovable pile of rubble and debris. {happy}Trapped for weeks, we’d be forced to resort to cannibalism just to survive.
16) SAM
The problem with this city is you can never find a phone exactly where you need it. {sarcastic}I can see why Sybil wanted to move out.

[pickup1] It’s some kind of mysterious tunnel.
26) MAX
[pickup1] I love those!
27) SAM
[pickup1] It’s too bad we can’t reach it from here.
28) SAM
[pickup1] As much as I’d love to get over there, I’m not quite willing to swim through the muck.
29) MAX
[pickup1] C’mon! I dare ya!
30) SAM
[pickup1] It’s too far away to see if there’s anything interesting and/or useful in there.
31) SAM
[pickup1] Well, I’ll be dipped... according to your spooky nutritional label, this Abe Lincoln head is almost entirely comprised of low-fat banana pudding.
32) MAX
[pickup1] Almost?
33) SAM
[pickup1] Well, it’s 99 percent pudding, and 1 percent cardboard.
34) MAX
[pickup1] Oh, I bet it’s a secret toy surprise!
35) SAM
[pickup1][reading] 100 percent banana pudding, with trace amounts of lead...
36) MAX
[pickup1] Too soon, Sam.
37) SAM
[pickup1] Looks like I owe you five bucks.
38) MAX
[pickup1] Why?
39) SAM
[pickup1] It turns out that Bosco’s gumballs really WERE made entirely out of medical waste.
40) MAX
[pickup1] Hah!
41) MAX
[pickup1] Gimme!
42) SAM
[pickup1] “Contained” is past tense, buckethead.
43) SAM
[pickup1] This soda contained enough caffeine to make a family of tree sloths do the watusi.
44) SAM
[pickup1] {suspicious} Foursquare and seven brides ago! {surprised}It’s a sculpture of Abe Lincoln’s head!
45) MAX
[pickup1] {suspicious} Sheesh, what will it take to get RID of that guy?
46) SAM
[pickup1] {sarcastic} He’s not a real guy, Max. I can’t be positive, {realizing}but it seems to be made out of... pudding?
47) MAX
[pickup1] [mild panic] {confused} Is it the annual city-wide pudding festival already? I feel unprepared.
48) SAM
[pickup1] {confused} Hmm, I wonder where that “cardboard” reading was coming from...
49) MAX
[pickup1] {surprised} Only one way to find out!
50) SAM
[pickup1] {stern} Oh, that’s unpleasant...
89) SAM
[pickup1] {stern} Oh, that’s unpleasant...
51) MAX
[pickup1] {realizing} Look what I found in Puddin’head Lincoln’s prefontal cortex!
52) SAM
[pickup1] {surprised} Hellzapoppin, Max! I’m not sure what the heck that is, {suspicious}but I’m sure it’ll be worth the horrible nightmares I’ll be having for the next few months.
53) MAX
[pickup1] {sarcastic} Aw, suck it up, ya big baby.
54) MAX
[pickup1] {sarcastic} You worry too much, Sam.
55) SAM
[pickup1] {confused} I’m not sure what’s more disturbing, {sarcastic} the fact that you lobotomized Puddin’head Lincoln, {suspicious} or that you did it without getting any pudding on your fur.
56) SAM
[pickup1] {suspicious} Even though he can’t think, has no arms, and is made of pudding, {realizing}there’s something about Puddin’head Lincoln that’d get my vote.
57) MAX
[pickup1][offended]{angry} Don’t vote for Puddin’head... he’s soft on crime. {sarcastic}Get it? Soft? Bwah ha ha ha!
58) SAM
[pickup1] {sad} This broken gumball machine always makes me wistfully nostalgic for earlier times.
59) MAX
[pickup1] {realizing} Like that time we smashed this gumball machine! That was great!
60) SAM
[pickup1] {suspicious} One of Bosco’s discarded “Giga Guzzler” soda cups.
61) MAX
[pickup1][wistfully] {happy} The only drink affected by the position of the moon...
62) MAX
[pickup1] Well, to be fair, they’ve been sub-contracting to the mutant alligators union. Those guys are notorious loafers.
63) SAM
[pickup1] Sheesh, the mole people are taking their own sweet time getting our subway station back into shape.
64) SAM
[pickup1] I’m starting to think our train’s not coming, Max.
65) MAX
[pickup1] It’s a good thing people generally wait for us to come talk to them before they do anything.
66) MAX
[pickup1] Oh boy! Whose head do we explode first?
67) SAM
[pickup1] [notices something halfway through] Not that kind of scan— what the?!
68) SAM
[pickup1] Some secret passage. It’s just a bunch of junk, like this old scanner.
69) SAM
[pickup1] {sarcastic} If I threw it over there, I might break Stinky’s phone. {angry}THEN where would I be?
70) MAX
[pickup1] {sarcastic} Stuck in a dead-end job with an annoying partner?
71) SAM
[pickup1] {surprised} Yeah, but without a phone!
72) SAM
[pickup1] {angry} Rosemary keeps wandering off and leaving this thing behind.
73) CONSTRUCTIONWORKER
Hey, either o’ you guys seen Charlie? He was s’posed to be back by now.
74) SAM
[pickup1] I’m not supposed to bother the construction workers when they’re on break. Which is always.
