1) MOMMABOSCO
What can I do for you boys?
2) MOMMABOSCO
{proud}Thanks for getting rid of those gorillas, Sam & Max!
3) MOMMABOSCO
How can I help, Sam & Max?
4) SUPERBALL
Doctor Momma Bosco has been granted the fullest security clearance possible for a dead citizen, Mr. President.
5) SAM
See you on the other side, Doctor Momma Bosco!
6) MOMMABOSCO
Not if I can get this destabilizer working.
7) SAM
{confused}Do you happen to know anything about a “power core”?
8) MOMMABOSCO
{stern}[suspicious] Where did you hear about that?
9) MAX
{incredulous}[bad liar] From mag...a...zines? About... pam...phlets?
10) MOMMABOSCO
[still suspicious] Hmpf. I had a power core stolen from my lab!
11) SAM
{confused}Who do you think stole your power core?
12) MOMMABOSCO
{stern}No idea. I’ve got a, {sarcastic}um, real detective on the case, though.
13) SAM
{sarcastic}It’s a good thing we’re trying to steal it, too, or we’d be offended by that remark.
14) MOMMABOSCO
{Stern}[ignoring Sam] Couldn’t have come at a worse time, either. {normal}I’ve almost got my dimensional destabilizer working, but the dimensional rift generator is useless without power.
15) MAX
{sarcastic}Man, if I had a nickel for every time I didn’t understand what you just said.
16) SAM
{confused}What did this power core thing look like?
17) MOMMABOSCO
{sarcastic}[gently mocking] What a question! {sarcastic}It looks like a power core! {enthused}You know! {happy}That’s like asking what a Banderpoont particle emitter looks like!
18) SAM
Did you hear about the alien gorilla that landed on our street?
19) MOMMABOSCO
Yeah, it came through on the News Alert. Something about sharing alien technology and ending all poverty and disease on Earth, right?
20) MAX
{worried}Well... yeah, {incredulous}but that’s just ONE PART of why he’s evil!
21) MOMMABOSCO
I’m sure he’s fine. {proud}I’m even gonna ask him if he can help me finish my dimensional destabilizer!
22) SAM
{stern}I’d be careful around that General Skunkape.
23) MOMMABOSCO
{sarcastic}You two don’t trust anybody, do you?
24) SAM
[defensive] What do you mean by that?
25) MAX
[defensive] {angry}Yeah, what are you trying to pull?
26) MOMMABOSCO
Just wait till he helps me with my inventions, {happy}then you’ll see he’s not such a bad guy.
27) SAM
{confused}What were General Skunkape’s minions doing in here?
28) MOMMABOSCO
{stern}They came in and took over the place right after I told him about my dimensional destabilizer!
29) SAM
{Stern}Well, that was uncalled for.
30) MAX
{sarcastic}Yeah, I mean, sure, she’s really boring about it, but that’s no excuse for violence.
31) MOMMABOSCO
I’m pretty sure he was trying to keep anybody from using my inventions against him!
32) SAM
{confused}Did Skunkape give you any idea what he’s got planned?
33) MOMMABOSCO
Nope, he just told his guards to make sure nobody found out about my inventions.
34) SAM
How’s the afterlife treating you, Mrs. Momma Bosco?
35) MOMMABOSCO
{stern}That’s DOCTOR Momma Bosco. {proud}I spent the summer getting my Ph.D. online.
36) MAX
{suspicious}I started to do that, but I kept {incredulous}getting distracted by all the funny cat pictures.
37) SAM
{stern}You don’t know how to use computers, Max. {normal}What’s your doctorate in, Momma Bosco?
38) MOMMABOSCO
{happy}Bridging the transdimensional gap to return spirits to their corporeal form. {proud}My master’s was in funny cat pictures.
39) SAM
{worried}Sounds like you’re tired of being a ghost.
40) MOMMABOSCO
Oh, it’s not all bad. {proud}I’m getting better at apparating. {stern}And now I don’t leave a trail of ectoplasmic slime behind every time I leave the room.
41) MAX
{sarcastic}That’s better than Sam can say.
42) MOMMABOSCO
{normal}But I’ll be glad when I finish my dimensional destabilizer and get my body back. I miss touching things.
43) MAX
{realizing}Yeah, touching is my third favorite thing to do to things.
44) MAX
{suspicious}In case anyone was curious, second is “licking.”
45) SAM
[trying to be polite] The new lab is, {confused}um, nice.
46) MOMMABOSCO
Thanks for saying so, but it needs work.{Stern} Do you have any idea how hard it is to find abandoned real estate in Manhattan that’s not already haunted?
47) MAX
{realizing}It IS a diers’ market.
48) MOMMABOSCO
{normal}I had to start reading the exorcism listings in the paper just to find a lead on THIS place!
49) SAM
{confused}Why didn’t you just set up your lab in the inconvenience store?
50) MOMMABOSCO
{Stern}Not everything happens on your street, Sam. {normal}Besides, that place isn’t zoned for mixed-use haunting.
51) MOMMABOSCO
They’ve got guys from the city coming by every day to evict me from THIS place. {stern}Only way to get rid of them is by making the walls bleed.
52) SAM
{confused}What’s the deal with Harry Moleman?
53) MOMMABOSCO
I don’t know. {sarcastic}Some things science can’t explain. If you’re asking why he’s here, he’s been pestering me to be my research assistant or something.
54) HARRY
[ominous] The friendly spirit says she can only speak through her trusted medium!
55) MAX
{worried}Give it up, Harry.
56) HARRY
{sad}[dejected] Sorry.
57) SAM
Doctor Momma Bosco, {enthused}your lab is actually pretty impressive! {incredulous}Bosco’s inventions always kind of...{confused} well...
58) MAX
{aloof}[context: finishing Sam’s sentence] Sucked.
59) MOMMABOSCO
[tactful] Yes. Well. {enthused}He was always a special boy.
60) SAM
{confused}Have you heard from Bosco?
61) MOMMABOSCO
He’s sent a few postcards. He and that {sarcastic}Bluster Blaster machine {normal}finally made it to Las Vegas.
62) SAM
I didn’t know Bosco liked gambling.
63) MOMMABOSCO
He said he’s got a “system.” {sarcastic}Plus fifteen billion dollars left over from the money that some idiots gave him for his inventions.
64) SAM
{stern}[offended] I’m sure those idiots had very good reasons.
65) SAM
You’re a doctor. {confused}Can you tell us anything about late-onset male psychic dysfunction?
66) MOMMABOSCO
Psychic powers? {sarcastic}It’s probably a melon-sized, deadly tumor.
67) MAX
{confused}“Probably”?
68) MOMMABOSCO
{normal}Well, it could be mind worms, of course, {sarcastic}but I don’t want to be alarmist. {stern}Most likely it’s the deadly tumor.
69) SAM
{enthused}Couldn’t Max just have the perfectly safe kind of non-lethal psychic powers?
70) MOMMABOSCO
[lying unconvincingly] Oh, it’s Max? Uh... {sarcastic}I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about then.
71) MOMMABOSCO
{normal}Could you, uh, have him stand a little farther away from my machines, though?
72) MAX
{suspicious}That’s why you’ll have to record it for me, Sam. Duh!
73) SAM
{confused}Are these psychic powers dangerous for Max at all?
74) MOMMABOSCO
Well... {sarcastic}probably not, if he’s careful and only uses them responsibly.
75) SAM
{incredulous}And what if it’s Max?
76) MOMMABOSCO
{normal}Well, he’ll over-work his brain so much that it catches fire and explodes.
77) MAX
{realizing}Oh, I have got to see that!
78) SAM
{stern}You CAN’T see that, Max. {worried}Your brain will catch fire and explode.
79) SAM
{confused}What does that dimensional destabilizer do, exactly?
80) MOMMABOSCO
{enthused}It opens a temporary gateway between one dimension and the next, which can pull someone from the spirit world into the real world...
81) SAM
{realizing}Or from the real world to an interdimensional prison?
82) MOMMABOSCO
{normal}I suppose so. Do you think that’s what Skun-ka’pe was trying to keep people from finding?
83) MAX
{sarcastic}I dunno, my money’s still on the big screen thing. {happy}That’s just cool.
84) MOMMABOSCO
Well, it’s worth a try. {proud}I built a remote control so you can open the gateway anywhere.
123) MOMMABOSCO
Well, it’s worth a try. {proud}I built a remote control so you can open the gateway anywhere.
85) MOMMABOSCO
{normal}It’ll only stay open a few minutes, so you’ve got to make sure you do it right. {enthused}Anybody holding something tuned to the alternate dimension will get sucked right in.
124) MOMMABOSCO
{normal}It’ll only stay open a few minutes, so you’ve got to make sure you do it right. {enthused}Anybody holding something tuned to the alternate dimension will get sucked right in.
86) SAM
Max is confused about how that dimensional destabilizer works.
87) MOMMABOSCO
You just have to find Skun-ka’pe and open up the gateway. {sarcastic}If he’s holding anything tuned to that dimension, he’ll get sucked right in.
88) MOMMABOSCO
The remote control for it is right over there.
89) SAM
{confused}Can’t we just use that destabilizer thing to open up another gateway?
90) SAM
{confused}How are we going to stop Skunkape now?
91) SUPERBALL
With the Penal Zone destroyed, we have no way to return him to prison.
92) MOMMABOSCO
[thinking] Unless... {enthused}you could make another Penal Zone somewhere else.
93) SAM
{suspicious}I smell a convoluted plan coming on!
94) MOMMABOSCO
Before I made the destabilizer, I was working on a dimensional rift generator. {proud}It doesn’t open a gateway to another dimension, it actually CREATES another dimension!
95) SAM
{confused}How does this rift generator work?
96) MOMMABOSCO
You just plug it in and press the pedal. {proud}After that, it works just like the destabilizer: {normal}if Skun’ka-pe is wearing that homing beacon, he’ll get pulled into the new dimension.
97) MOMMABOSCO
The trick is finding enough power for it.
98) MOMMABOSCO
It’s over there {sarcastic}with the other inventions that are a deadly radiation hazard.
99) MOMMABOSCO
{normal}Only problem is, you’ll have to find a nexus of ley lines somewhere for it to work,{enthused} a place where the border between reality and nonsense has broken down...
100) SUPERBALL
{proud}There happens to be one of those in the city, ma’am. It’s at 1313 Straight Street.
101) MAX
{confused}That address sounds familiar.
102) SAM
{realizing}That’s OUR building!
103) SAM
{confused}So you’re suggesting we trap Skunkape in our own building?
104) MOMMABOSCO
Well, kind of. {proud}You’d actually be turning your building into an alternate dimension, {sarcastic}so it won’t really exist anymore.
105) SUPERBALL
I’m afraid it’s the only way, sirs.
106) MAX
On the plus side, if it doesn’t exist, {happy}think of how much money we’ll save on rent!
107) SAM
We don’t pay rent, Max.
108) SUPERBALL
Not now that the Penal Zone has been destroyed.
109) SUPERBALL
You’ll have to use Momma Bosco’s rift generator to create a new Penal Zone.
110) SAM
{confused}Do you have any more of those power cores lying around?
111) MOMMABOSCO
No, I never did get that back! {Stern}But even so, it would have taken a hundred of those things to give enough power to a dimensional rift generator!
112) MAX
{realizing}With a side order of hand-waving technical nonsense, {happy}extra crispy.
