1) GRANDPASTINKY
{sarcastic}[sarcastic] Oh, good. You two are back to barrage me with your inane questions.
2) SAM
We missed you, too, Grandpa Stinky!
3) MAX
{incredulous}[non-sequitur] Do the health inspectors ever make you wear a beard net?
4) GRANDPASTINKY
What is it NOW?
5) GRANDPASTINKY
Was all that really necessary?
6) SAM
{normal}Sorry. Max is all short-term memory. I have to bring him back up to speed every once in a while.
7) MAX
{surprised}[suddenly surprised to see Sam] Ahhh! Giant talking dog!
8) SAM
How’s the diner business treating you?
9) GRANDPASTINKY
It’s been all I can do just to turn this back into a place that lures {angry}DECENT people in to eat!
10) MAX
{incredulous}The carefully placed rat droppings are one of those flourishes you don’t notice until they’re missing.
11) GRANDPASTINKY
Did ye see all the “decorations” she’d scattered about? Rubbish!
12) STINKY
{sarcastic}[under her breath] At least THEN we had some customers.
13) GRANDPASTINKY
{sarcastic}[sarcastic] Aye, ye really appealed to the lucrative insect and talking statue demographic, I’ll give ye that.
14) SAM
It must be great getting back to work with your partner again...
15) MAX
{suspicious}I don’t know, he’s kind of cramping my style... {normal}oh, you were talking to HIM. Never mind.
16) GRANDPASTINKY
{sarcastic}[sarcastic] Oh, it’s great. She has me working the register and making deliveries. {angry}A master chef like meself, and she won’t even let me in the kitchen!
17) STINKY
{sarcastic}[lying] I already explained, Grandpa: I just have to make it... {suspicious}nicer, so that it’s um, worthy of your skills.
18) GRANDPASTINKY
{angry}Paaaah!
19) SAM
Ah, you and Girl Stinky will be working like a mole-man-oiled machine in no time.
20) GRANDPASTINKY
{angry}Mark my words, boyo...
21) MAX
{confused}“Boyo”? Do people really say that, Sam?
22) GRANDPASTINKY
...that woman will be the death of me!
23) STINKY
{sarcastic}[under her breath, suspiciously] That’s the idea.
24) SAM
{sarcastic}And burning it down, most likely.
25) GRANDPASTINKY
{happy}Skun-ka’pe is a true commander! He’s going places! I could even see him making it to the White House!
26) GRANDPASTINKY
{happy}[context: I know who that is!] General Skun-ka’pe? {sarcastic}We’d do well to have MORE of his kind in this neighborhood! {angry}Instead of these shiftless layabouts loitering around until somebody comes to ask them questions.
27) MAX
[confidentially] {incredulous}Wow, I never would’ve guessed Grandpa Stinky was so prejudiced against non-player characters.
28) SAM
As part of the Freelance Neighborhood Watch, we’re warning everybody about an alien gorilla on the street...
29) GRANDPASTINKY
Yes. Well. Your term will be over soon. One way or another.
30) SAM
{worried}Just be careful around Skunkape.
31) GRANDPASTINKY
{suspicious}[dismissive] Pah, you just don’t trust him because he’s not human!
32) MAX
{confused}[context: that doesn’t make sense] Uh... what?
33) GRANDPASTINKY
{happy}He’s welcome here anytime. [pointedly]{normal}My granddaughter could do a lot worse than to court {happy}a magnificent specimen like General Skun-ka’pe.
34) STINKY
{disgusted}Eww, gross.
35) SAM
Can’t you and Girl Stinky just get along?
36) MAX
All this negative energy is bad for my psychic balance.
37) GRANDPASTINKY
SHE’s the one locking a master chef like ME {angry}out of his own kitchen!
38) GRANDPASTINKY
Pah, {happy}it won’t be a problem after I perfect me recipe and make me fortune!
39) MAX
{incredulous}That was like 30 years ago!
40) SAM
What’s cooking?
41) GRANDPASTINKY
{happy}Oh, you’d LIKE me to tell you about me Demon Broth, wouldn’t you? {angry}So you can STEAL ANOTHER PATENT!
42) SAM
{incredulous}Come on, you’re not still angry about that, are you?
43) GRANDPASTINKY
{normal}And that’s 30 years I could’ve been living off the riches from my gooey molasses tar cake!
44) SAM
{normal}Can’t you at least tell us what’s in it?
45) GRANDPASTINKY
{suspicious}If you’re so curious about it, pick up a can after {happy}I’ve made a fortune selling it to every grocery store from here to Madagascar!
46) SAM
{confused}What’s so great about that demon broth, anyway?
47) GRANDPASTINKY
{happy}What’s great is that it’s nutrient rich, {normal}that it’s mine, {angry}and that I’m not letting you two parasites anywhere near it!
48) GRANDPASTINKY
{happy}Once I’ve perfected this recipe, I’ll never need to worry about money again!
49) SAM
{confused}Isn’t it kind of overkill to have a radio AND a jukebox?
50) GRANDPASTINKY
{angry}Anything to drown out the noise my granddaughter calls “music.” It ruins the digestion!
51) MAX
{realizing}To be fair, Sam, Stinky’s food DOES require you to be 100% focused on digestion.
52) SAM
What station are you listening to?
53) GRANDPASTINKY
There be only ONE station worth listenin’ to in the greater New York area: WSNT.
54) RADIOANNOUNCER
You’re listening to WSNT: all sea shanties, all the time. Yo ho!
55) SAM
Stay cheerful, Grandpa Stinky!
56) GRANDPASTINKY
Paaah!
57) SAM
{sarcastic}Isn’t that brooch a little fancy-pants for you, Grandpa Stinky?
58) GRANDPASTINKY
{angry}‘Tain’t a brooch, you cretin. {happy}It’s a badge of honor! General Skun-ka’pe was so grateful for my donation that he made me his second in command!
59) SAM
{confused}Where are his “Outer Dominions,” exactly?
60) GRANDPASTINKY
{normal}I don’t know, he told me to command them from inside the diner. {happy}I think it stretches from Alpha Centauri to the Andromeda Galaxy. {normal}And Brooklyn, of course.
61) SAM
{worried}That badge looks dangerous, Grandpa Stinky. You’d better let us have it.
62) GRANDPASTINKY
{disgusted}[context: preposterous!] Let you have it?! {normal}This badge gives me command over General Skun-ka’pe’s entire Fifth Legion and Outer Dominions! {suspicious}I’m not gonna give it to the likes of you!
63) SAM
Can’t we just borrow your badge?
64) GRANDPASTINKY
Pah, {angry}even if you WEREN’T a couple of shiftless ape-traitors, my captain ordered me never to take it off. [afterthought]{suspicious}And to keep at least 50 feet away from him at all times, for some reason.
65) SAM
How’s life as a multi-millionaire, Grandpa Stinky?
66) GRANDPASTINKY
{happy}So you’re starting to regret handing over that ticket, are ye? I almost feel bad, takin’ it from ye, but consider it a life lesson. You’ve got to be a lot more clever to outsmart an old salt like Stinky!
67) MAX
What are you gonna do with all the money?
68) GRANDPASTINKY
Oh, I already gave it away!
69) SAM
{confused}You what?
70) GRANDPASTINKY
To General Skun-ka’pe! Haven’t ye heard him talk about the big plans he has for the planet? Inspiring! And since he made me his second in command, I never have to worry about money again!
71) SAM
{confused}You just gave away hundreds of million dollars to an alien gorilla?
72) GRANDPASTINKY
Ye make it sound like I didn’t get anything in return! {happy}I got this badge, and command of an entire alien fleet!
73) MAX
{cocky}That IS pretty cool, Sam.
74) SAM
{realizing}[reluctantly] Well, yeah. Especially if he threw in the badge.
75) SAM
{stern}Skunkape’s a total dillweed, Grandpa Stinky. We’re placing him under arrest.
76) MAX
Well, we’re getting around to it. Eventually.
77) GRANDPASTINKY
{angry}[angry] Traitors! I knew it! Just wait until the general hears about this!
78) SAM
{confused}You know where he is?
79) GRANDPASTINKY
Well... {normal}no. And I’m not supposed to go near him. {angry}But you two are in for a world of hurt once he gets my memo!
80) SAM
{stern}General Skunkape’s got you brainwashed, Grandpa Stinky!
81) MAX
{angry}[threatening, doesn’t realize how stupid it sounds] Yeah! And he hung you out to dry to avoid further shrinkage!
82) GRANDPASTINKY
Pah, {angry}you gentle free-loving hippie peacenik types just can’t appreciate a REAL leader who’s not afraid to use his weapons!
83) MAX
{incredulous}[to Sam] He really doesn’t know us at all, does he?
84) SAM
This is your last warning, Grandpa Stinky. {stern}We’re taking down the whole Skunkape Army.
85) SAM
Okay, {Stern}THIS is your last warning, for real. We’re taking down the whole Skunkape Army!
86) GRANDPASTINKY
{angry}Don’t forget who you’re talking to, traitors. As long as I wear this badge, my loyalty is with the general!
87) SAM
{worried}I’d better get out of here before things get violent.
88) SAM
All hail Skunkape!
89) GRANDPASTINKY
[sacred oath/salute] Peace through destruction!
90) SAM
We’ve had a sudden change of heart. {enthused}We think Skunkape is awesome!
91) MAX
{happy}Where do we sign up to join the Skunkape Army?
92) GRANDPASTINKY
{suspicious}[disbelief] You two? In the Skun-ka’pe Army? {happy}Don’t make me laugh!
93) SAM
[context: we can do that!] We’re really good at not making people laugh!
94) MAX
{normal}Why CAN’T we be in the Skunkape Army?
95) GRANDPASTINKY
{normal}For starters, {sarcastic}have ye ever actually HIT anything with that gun of yours, Fido?
96) SAM
{stern}[offended] Now that’s just not nice.
97) MAX
{angry}Grrrrrrr!
98) SAM
{worried}Uh oh. You’ve made him angry.
99) GRANDPASTINKY
{normal}And as for Harvey here, {sarcastic}he’ll be a fine soldier until we run into a “you must be this tall to invade this planet” sign.
100) SAM
We really want to join the Skunkape Army, Grandpa Stinky! {enthused}Max needs to pay for college.
101) GRANDPASTINKY
{Sarcastic}Why don’t you ladies run back to your knitting and scrapbooking {angry}and leave the army work to the REAL men? {normal}And gorillas?
102) MAX
{angry}[really angry] That does it!
103) SAM
Come on, Grandpa Stinky! {worried}Let us in the Skunkape Army!
104) GRANDPASTINKY
{sarcastic}As soon as we drop the weight, height, and competency requirements, I’ll get back to ye.
105) MAX
{angry}[angry] Take it back!
106) SAM
Settle down, Max.
107) MAX
{happy}[excited] Oh! New thing!
108) GRANDPASTINKY
{happy}[happy] Not even the Freelance Police can put me in a bad mood today! Do your worst.
109) GRANDPASTINKY
[happy] He he, it is pretty cool, isn’t it! {angry}[angry] But don’t touch! And no animals on the counter!
110) GRANDPASTINKY
{angry}Ye’d best make this quick, traitors!

[pickup1] [long, clumsy exposition] Boy, Grandpa Stinky, I sure am glad to see you back working in this diner again after returning from a long time away to work with your granddaughter who is also coincidentally named Stinky.
