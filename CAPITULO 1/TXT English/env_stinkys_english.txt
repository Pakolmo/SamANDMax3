1) SAM
Need a hard hat, Flint?
2) FLINT
Thanks, but no thanks, fellas. {arrogant}Safety’s not my style.
3) FLINT
That’s swell, fellas, but—
4) SAM
We’d feel better if you wore this hard hat, Flint.
5) FLINT
{worried}[shocked] PEANUTS?!
6) FLINT
{angry}[angry] You know I’m allergic to peanuts, Stinky! Are you trying to kill me?
7) FLINT
{normal}[to Sam & Max] Something’s fishy with that dame. Now what do you want to know?
8) STINKY
{sarcastic}[nervous denial] Ha ha, kill you? Don’t be silly!
9) FLINT
{disgusted}[moved] Aww, you’re right, pals.{normal} I’ve just been thinking of myself all this time. {happy}Hand it over.
10) MAX
[pointedly] Doris would want you to have it.
11) SAM
I guess having just a jukebox wasn’t loud and annoying enough.
12) GRANDPASTINKY
{suspicious}A lottery ticket? Pah! {angry}Don’t ye know that nobody ever wins these... [cut off by radio announcer]
13) GRANDPASTINKY
Pah, take it! After today, I never need to worry about money again!
14) SAM
{confused}What about your super-secret demon broth?
15) GRANDPASTINKY
Did you hear that? I TOLD ye I would win!
16) RADIOANNOUNCER
This just in... in a surprising upset, we’re told that the winning ticket was transferred to local diner owner Grandpa Stinky. Sorry, Harry Moleman! Better luck next time!
17) RADIOANNOUNCER
We interrupt this program for a breaking news bulletin: officials for the city’s 700 million dollar lottery jackpot drawing have announced that there is one winning ticket, sold to unemployed and somewhat pathetic Moleopolis resident Harry Moleman.
18) SAM
We’re all torn up about stealing your patent 30 years ago, Grandpa Stinky. Maybe this will make up for it.
19) GRANDPASTINKY
{happy}Wha ha! So long, suckers!
20) SAM
{happy}Wow! Would you look at that, Max? Amazing!
21) MAX
{aloof}[deadpan] It’s a secret passage, Sam. Really not that big a deal.
22) FLINT
{disgusted}[dying] Tell Doris... sorry... I wasn’t more... careful...
23) STINKY
{cellphoneStanding}[talking on phone] I was hoping you’d call. No, no, no, don’t speak! Those detectives are finally gone, but someone might be listening in. We should meet in person.
24) SAM
We’d better find a use for this quick, Max. {worried}I don’t like the way it sloshes around in my coat and gets everything disconcertingly moist.
25) MAX
{aloof}Oh sure, blame the demon broth.
26) MAX
{aloof}[slightly annoyed] We’ve been hearing that an awful lot lately.
27) STINKY
[talking on phone] Perfect, I’ll leave right away.
28) STINKY
[talking on phone] What? Of course not! And Sam & Max don’t suspect a thing.
29) SAM
{suspicious}Looks like SOMEBODY had an old ship’s wheel lying around and just threw it up on the wall.
30) MAX
{sarcastic}You hear the phrase “threw it up on the wall” a lot around here.
31) SAM
{enthused}From the days when captains’ wives would stand on the beach, looking out towards the ocean, longing for the day the waitress would come back with the check.
32) SAM
{realizing}[asking permission] Is anybody gonna eat this?
33) SAM
I knew Flint Paper was brave, {worried}but ordering Spaghetti a la Stinky is just plain reckless.
34) SAM
Stinky’s award-winning spaghetti, mentioned in the past five issues of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s Journal of Workplace Hazards.
35) SAM
Convenient his and hers post-dinner purging barrels.
36) SAM
{confused}Hmm, they still haven’t added “Banjo & Bagpipe Fantasia” or anything by Max’s favorite Chilean nu metal bands.
37) MAX
{sarcastic}It’s almost like those 42,000 comments & suggestions cards I filled out were a waste of time.
38) SAM
A long coil of rope might be useful... {worried}if it weren’t made of fiberglass, varnished, and bolted to the floor.
39) SAM
This phone only accepts Dutch guilder coins.
40) MAX
{aloof}Sorry, Sam. All I’ve got are some yuan, a few Euros, and six bucks in Italian lira.
41) SAM
{confused}Where do you keep all that change?
42) MAX
{regal}That’s none of your damn business.
43) MAX
In my sock, of course.
44) SAM
You’re naked! Where do you keep your sock?
45) SAM
{realizing}You’re right, Max. {stern}And he won’t stop pestering me about the twenty bucks he loaned me.
46) SAM
I could probably empty out this cash register and no one would know.
47) MAX
{aloof}[stern] God would know, Sam.
48) SAM
{worried}I can’t shoot Flint Paper! Max would never forgive me.
49) SAM
Just hand over the cheesy jalapeño poppers and nobody has to get hurt.
50) STINKY
{disgusted}[annoyed] Hello? What part of “please wait to be seated” don’t you understand?
51) MAX
{aloof}Well, all right. But this is coming out of your tip, lady!
52) MAX
{sarcastic}No kidding! You should really wear some sort of protective headgear if you’re gonna fall face first into a plate of spaghetti.
53) SAM
{worried}Wow, that looked painful.
186) SAM
{worried}Wow, that looked painful.
54) MAX
{confused}How come all the coolest stuff is kept behind counters? {angry}It’s like they don’t trust us, Sam.
55) SAM
{stern}Yeah, somehow I don’t see us getting back there with all these Stinkys hanging around.
56) GRANDPASTINKY
{suspicious}Oh, you’d LIKE to steal my super-secret Demon Broth recipe, wouldn’t ye? {angry}Well, hands off!
57) MAX
Come on, Stinky, stop fighting it. {sarcastic}You know we’re just gonna take it as soon as we find some way to get rid of you.
58) GRANDPASTINKY
{angry}FAH! I’ll win the lottery {sarcastic}before you ever get your conniving paws on my masterpiece.

{angry}Paaaah!
73) SAM
[pickup1] Yikes!
74) MAX
[pickup1] What?
75) SAM
[pickup1] Your Nutri-Specs indicate that, aside from the expected levels of snark, coffee ice cream, tar, and fish sticks, Girl Stinky is chock full of... love!
76) MAX
[pickup1] You must be reading that thing wrong.
77) MAX
[pickup1] As a certified coffee achiever, I demand to know what’s in Grandpa Stinky’s crummy coffee!
78) SAM
[pickup1][reading] Hmm. Looks like nothing but coffee.
79) MAX
[pickup1] What, no gym socks? No squid ink? No exotic subatomic particles?
80) SAM
[pickup1] Nope, nothing but coffee. Really horrible coffee.
81) MAX
[pickup1] I feel a curious combination of relief and annoyance.
82) SAM
[pickup1] Judging from the elevated levels of hair gel, gold chains and pinkie rings in this pie, I think we can finally close the case of Lester the Lisping Loan Shark.
83) SAM
[pickup1] This half-eaten “bagonut” is actually made of pork, red dye, and children’s glue.
84) MAX
[pickup1] Ooh, unhealthy AND unkosher.
85) SAM
[pickup1] Let’s see what’s in Grandpa Stinky’s mysterious demon broth...
86) SAM
[pickup1][reading] Celery... chicken stock... carrots...
87) MAX
[pickup1] BORing!
88) SAM
[pickup1] [reading, continuing] Finely ground cherub bones... minced albino buffalo tongues...
89) MAX
[pickup1][impatient] What is this, a demon broth or a kindergarten pot luck? Where’s the EVIL?
90) SAM
[pickup1] Ah, here we go... 2 percent aspartame.
91) MAX
[pickup1] The fiend!
92) SAM
[pickup1] Surprisingly, this plate of spaghetti seems on the up-and-up... nothing but dough, water, ground beef, tomatoes, and something called “arachis hypogea.”
93) MAX
[pickup1] What’s that?
94) SAM
[pickup1] I think it’s Latin for “parmesean cheese.”
95) SAM
[pickup1] No wonder Flint freaked out... this thing has got “Arachis hypogea” sprinkled all over it!
96) MAX
[pickup1] Archi what now?
97) SAM
[pickup1] Peanuts, peanut brain.
98) MAX
[pickup1][lisping] Godthpeed, Lethter!
99) SAM
[pickup1] Algae, fish poop, rust... yup, this tank is 100 percent fish free.
100) MAX
[pickup1] Uh, so what HAVE we been eating here every Friday?
101) SAM
{confused}[pickup1] You know, now that I think about it, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a fish in this aquarium.
102) MAX
{sarcastic}[pickup1] They’re probably just hiding from the Stinkys.
103) MAX
[pickup1] The insect bits give the dough that extra bit of crunch!
104) SAM
[pickup1] Ever since Girl Stinky took over the kitchen, Stinky’s signature pies have gotten marginally more edible.
105) SAM
[pickup1] Songs have been sung about Stinky’s awful coffee.
106) MAX
[pickup1][starting to sing] My diuretic friend...
107) SAM
[pickup1] {incredulous}[context: interrupting Max] Songs we don’t sing.
108) MAX
[pickup1]{stern} [context: darn!] Rats.
109) SAM
[pickup1] Wow, Grandpa Stinky really IS nothing but a seething cauldron of bitterness, rage, and bile.
110) MAX
[pickup1] We needed mystical psychic specs to tell us THAT?
111) SAM
[pickup1] Well, his sodium level’s a little high.
112) SAM
[pickup1] Flint’s fists are made of steel, his belly is full of booze, his lungs are a symphony of cigarette smoke and cheap perfume, and his brain is awash in regrets and revenge.
113) MAX
[pickup1] That’s one damn poetic nutritional card, Sam.
114) SAM
[pickup1] Ahhh, Stinky’s Diner. The perfect place to catch up with old friends.
115) MAX
[pickup1] And meet new ones, like emergency medical technicians, and the friendly folks at Poison Control!
116) SAM
[pickup1] [context: seeing it on the wall] A souvenir from Grandpa Stinky’s first food order.
117) MAX
[pickup1] And the first city-wide trichinosis outbreak in decades.
118) SAM
[pickup1] [context: caught sneaking] Um... shame on you, Max! You know how Stinky explicitly told us never to go back in the kitchen!
119) SAM
[pickup1] [context: caught sneaking] Err... we, uh... got lost, Stinky. Our table must be on the OTHER side of the counter.
120) SAM
[pickup1] It’s locked from the inside.
121) MAX
[pickup1] It’s just as well. Seeing how they make the food would ruin the magic.
122) SAM
[pickup1] You’re right, pal.
123) SAM
{suspicious}[pickup1] I didn’t want to go in there, anyway.
124) SAM
[pickup1] {sarcastic}Just because the food’s bad is no excuse to take it out on the kitchen.
125) SAM
[pickup1] {sarcastic}Nah, Grandpa Stinky’s survived this long on pure spite. I don’t want to break his record.
126) RADIOANNOUNCER
[pickup1] And that was “Paddy Me Up the Dingle Down” by Cap’n Cod and the Crusty Salts. Stay tuned for more shanties and breaking news.
127) RADIOANNOUNCER
[pickup1] Coming up soon, an important bulletin. And tune in this Friday, Friday, Friday for our ALL CONCERTINA WEEKEND!
128) RADIOANNOUNCER
[pickup1] Coming up, the latest news. But first: more songs about whales and icebergs!
129) SAM
[pickup1] [sarcastic, smarmy, context: giving her an engagement ring] {sarcastic}I don’t think Girl Stinky’s the marrying kind, if you know what I mean.
130) MAX
[pickup1] {confused}Uh... what DO you mean?
131) SAM
[pickup1] I have no idea.
132) SAM
[pickup1][reading] Vanilla, ice cream, and... yak milk?
133) MAX
[pickup1] No WONDER I always wanna yak after drinking one of these!
134) SAM
[pickup1] Got any idea where Girl Stinky scampered off to?
135) GRANDPASTINKY
[pickup1] {disgusted}Pfah! How should I know? The ungrateful wretch comes and goes at the drop of a hat! And does she ever tell her overworked grandpa where she’s going in such a blasted hurry?
136) MAX
[pickup1] {incredulous}Well? Does she?
137) GRANDPASTINKY
[pickup1] NO!
138) SAM
[pickup1] {confused}[context: looking at a milkshake] Strawberry?
139) MAX
[pickup1] {aloof}Beet juice and ham.
140) SAM
[pickup1] We’re all torn up about trying to steal your demon broth, Grandpa Stinky. Maybe this will make up for it.
141) SAM
[pickup1] Sheesh, Grandpa Stinky. We just thought you could stand to get out of the diner once in a while.

I sure hope those psychic powers aren’t a danger to the people you work on or around, Max.
168) SAM
These psychic powers of yours are pretty neat.
169) MAX
I can’t believe Skunkape just let us walk into his ship unsupervised. It’s like he’s never even met us.
170) MAX
I’m tired of interdimensional space gorillas, Sam. Let’s go for a drive.
