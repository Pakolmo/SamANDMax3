1) MAX
[sniffing]{incredulous}Skunkape was here... twenty... no, {suspicious}twenty-eight minutes ago. [more sniffing]{sarcastic}He should really get more fiber in his diet.
2) SAM
{suspicious} There’s got to be some clue telling us where he went next. {sarcastic}Keep your beady little eyes open, pal.
3) SAM
{happy} Good work, Max! Now let’s see if we can...
4) SAM
{enthused} AHA! A clue!
5) MAX
A paddle ball toy?
6) SAM
Skunkape must’ve tossed it out when he realized it wasn’t magical. We’ve gotta find what store he got it from.
7) SAM
[as an afterthought] And pick up that phone, Max.
8) MAX
{suspicious} I’m not touching it.
9) MAX
{enthused} Mmmm... hot and delicious, dripping with rollover minutes!
10) SAM
{surprised} Swallowed whole! {enthused} I’ve never seen anything like that before!
11) MAX
{sarcastic} Not since we accidentally wandered into that theater on Times Square.
12) MAX
No need to teleport! We’re already here.
13) MAX
{confused} How are we supposed to get on the roof?
14) SAM
{sarcastic} What a senseless waste of perfectly-soiled pizza boxes.
15) MAX
{happy} The boxes are the tastiest part!
16) SAM
[reading] {sarcastic} Meesta Pizza.
17) SAM
[reciting a slogan] {happy} “For the Unforgettable Taste of Old Nipples.”
18) MAX
{confused} Uh, isn’t that supposed to be “Old Naples”?
19) SAM
{realizing} They had to change it on account of truth-in-advertising laws.
20) SAM
[satisfied] {happy} Ahh. You can’t get taste like that from REAL cheese.
21) MAX
{confused} Uh, were we supposed to be looking for clues or something?
22) SAM
No clues in there.
23) SAM
Anything valuable in here has already been carried away by rats or other animals.
24) MAX
Hey Sam, they mentioned seeing a giant space gorilla around here. {incredulous}Do you think that could be General Skunkape?
25) SAM
{realizing} Hmm, could be. {suspicious}Let’s see if he left a clue somewhere out back.
26) SAM
These boxes have been picked clean.
27) MAX
{sarcastic} The pigeons carry the wood-like crusts away to build nests and primitive temples to their pigeon god!
28) SAM
Anything I put here would get stolen by those chubby sky-rats.
29) SAM
Max, you ever get the feeling you’re going to do something really clever in the future, but you haven’t figured out what it is yet?

[pickup1] {angry} Meesta Pizza? Bah, rubbish.
35) SAM
[pickup1] Hmmm. Looks like Meesta Pizza’s “Meat Hugger’s Explosion” has been using a particularly broad definition of “meat.”
36) MAX
[pickup1] [indignant] Hey, lips CAN be meat!
37) SAM
[pickup1] [reading] Hey Max, check this out. Meesta Pizza’s Swamp Dish Delight has started using artificial cooter beak FLAVORING instead of authentic cooter beaks paste.
38) MAX
[pickup1] I THOUGHT my acid reflux tasted less cootery the last time I was here.
39) SAM
[pickup1] From the looks of things, someone couldn’t get through their Deep Dish Swamp Ditch Delight.
40) MAX
[pickup1] Wimp.
41) SAM
[pickup1] Looks like this little fella’s had his fill of Meesta Pizza’s rotting remnants for one day.
42) MAX
[pickup1] Can I poke his belly with a pencil and make him explode in a horrific shower of dough and anchovies?
43) SAM
[pickup1] Maybe later.
44) SAM
[pickup1][reading] Lime, silica, gypsum... no wonder this poor little guy can’t move. He’s got more cement in his gut than the Hoover Dam.
45) MAX
[pickup1] Gypsum? You just made that up, didn’t you?
46) SAM
[pickup1] Even if that pigeon WASN’T stuffed to the gills, I don’t think it’d eat anything that doesn’t taste like Meesta Pizza pizza.
47) MAX
[pickup1] Pigeons don’t have gills, Sam.
48) SAM
[pickup1] Idiot.
49) SAM
[pickup1] It’s locked, broken, and doesn’t go anywhere we want to go.
50) MAX
[pickup1] Just like our social life.
51) SAM
Hmm, a vintage postcard from somebody who collects old, rare toys.
52) SAM
I don’t know, Max. The name and most of the address are smudged out. This looks like a job for the Crime-Tron!
53) MAX
What’s the address?
54) MAX
[pickup1] Well, that’s just a typical Friday night for YOU, Sam.

{happy}What’s the word, pals?
70) MAX
Don’t bother him, Sam!
71) 

72) SAM
[pickup1] Flint’s fists are made of steel, his belly is full of booze, his lungs are a symphony of cigarette smoke and cheap perfume, and his brain is awash in regrets and revenge.
73) MAX
[pickup1] That’s one damn poetic nutritional card, Sam.
