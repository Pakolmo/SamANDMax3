1) SAM
I need an outlet.
2) MAX
Have you considered woodworking, or maybe blogging?
3) SAM
A POWER outlet, chucklehead.
4) SAM
[talking on phone] Meesta Pizza? I want an extra large thick crust with one half peanut butter and passion fruit, the other half with watermelon ONLY.
5) SAM
[talking on phone] Okay, and two... no, three orders of cheesy dingles. Gouda... no, brie. Right. And extra fudge sauce. Okay, thanks!
6) SAM
[to Max] Do you want cheesy dingles, Max?
7) MAX
You have to ask?
8) MAX
How long ‘til it gets here?
9) SAM
Probably never, Max. Nobody answered.
10) MOMMABOSCO-PHONE
[process phone] You’ve reached BoscoTech Labs, the city’s leading research facility for scientific breakthroughs with a woman’s touch.
11) MAX
“Science” and “woman’s touch” are two things you hardly ever hear together.
12) MOMMABOSCO-PHONE
[process phone] I’m dead right now, but feel free to call again later.
13) GRANDPASTINKY-PHONE
[process phone] Pahhh, ye’ve reached Stinky’s Diner.
14) STINKY
[process phone] [threatening] Say it, grandpa...
15) GRANDPASTINKY-PHONE
[process phone] [begrudging] Ahhhh, all right. Home of the Colossal Bloomin’ Avocado Tastebanger Deluxe.
16) GRANDPASTINKY-PHONE
[process phone] Place your order at the beep and one of our polite delivery people will rush it to ye, if he ever gets the chance. WHICH HE WON’T!
17) SAM
Sybil’s still on her honeymoon. Kind of pointless to try and call her, in retrospect.
18) STINKY-PHONE
[process telephone] I was hoping you’d call. No, no, no, don’t speak! Those detectives are finally gone, but someone might be listening in. We should meet in person.
19) SAM
You must have me confused with someone else. I wanted one of your lobster-fed piglet buffet platters to go, please.
20) SAM
She hung up on me! How rude.
21) SAM
[poorly disguising his voice] Yes! Ha ha! We should go to, uh... that place... with the things... that you like.
22) STINKY-PHONE
[process telephone] Perfect, I’ll leave right away.
23) SAM
[poorly disguising his voice] {sarcastic} See you wherever that is, then... uh, my love.
24) SAM
Oh yeah, one more thing: are your corn dogs REALLY made with 100% pure beef?
25) STINKY-PHONE
[process telephone] What? Of course not! And Sam & Max don’t suspect a thing.
26) MAX
Well that’s a relief. Ever since the Dairy Freeze shut down, Stinky’s corn dogs have been my only source of nutritious pig sphincters!
27) SAM
[creepy] Have you checked the baby?
28) SAM
See, Max? He’s fine. I told you to stop worrying.
29) MAX
What kind of pretend mother would I be if I didn’t worry about our imaginary baby?
30) MAX
Aren’t you going to answer that, Sam?
31) SAM
Nah, there’s no telling who it might be.
32) SAM
Hmm, there’s no answer.
33) SAM
There’s no answer. I must’ve left the phone somewhere.
34) MOVIEFONE
Hello and welcome to the TeleVoice Comunitron Extreme 5000, with over 800 messaging features available!
35) MOVIEFONE
Please say the name of the person you want to call.
36) MAX
Oh boy! Now I can finally set up my 24-hour adults-only naked bunny chat line.
37) MOVIEFONE
We’re sorry, we’ve lost my manual for that feature.
38) SAM
Can you make phone calls?
39) MOVIEFONE
That I can handle.
40) SYNTH
I CAN ALSO HELP ORGANIZE YOUR COMPACT DISC COLLECTION.
41) MOVIEFONE
If a piece of evidence is found on our database, you’ll hear this noise:
42) BLEEPS
[affirmative beep] Beep!
43) MOVIEFONE
If the Crime-Tron can find a connection between the two pieces of evidence...
44) BLEEPS
[victory beep] Beep-ba-da-Beep!
45) SYNTH
ADVANCED DATA ANALYSIS ALGORITHMS WILL COMPARE THE EVIDENCE AGAINST OUR 64KB DATABASE AT UP TO 12 CALCULATIONS PER SECOND.
46) MOVIEFONE
You’re not helping. It’s really not all that complicated.
47) MOVIEFONE
It looks like you’re using the Crime-Tron. Would you like help?
48) SAM
Sure, but keep it short.
49) SAM
[context: “No, I understand.”] No, I got this.
50) SAM
This remote control can open a gateway to the Penal Zone!
51) SAM
It’s Stinky’s newfangled cellular telephone.
52) SAM
It’s that poor mole man’s vacation ticket.
53) SAM
Formerly Harry Moleman’s winning lottery ticket.
54) SAM
That construction worker would’ve wanted us to have his hard hat.
55) SAM
It’s a couple of gallons of Grandpa Stinky’s nutrient-rich demon broth.
56) SAM
Just jumper cables. Not much to ‘em, really.
57) SAM
Seems like a lot of fuss for a futuristic car battery.
58) SAM
Grandpa Stinky must’ve gotten this shot glass from Meesta Pizza when he went to meet Skunkape.
59) SAM
One of Skunkape’s minions left behind this torn receipt from a toy store.
60) SAM
Skunkape must’ve dropped this paddle ball toy while he was searching the city.
61) SAM
It’s Momma Bosco’s dimensional rift generator.
62) SAM
It’s a vintage postcard from a collector of rare toys. But the address has been smudged out.
63) MAX
There must be a hundred Meesta Pizzas in the city!
64) SAM
A hundred and forty-two, pal. So which one did Skunkape go to?
65) SAM
A banana peel, just bursting with comic possibilities.
66) SAM
I don’t want to use that until Skunkape is nearby.
67) SAM
I don’t want to use up Stinky’s minutes.
68) MAX
Admit it, Sam. You don’t know how to turn it on.
69) SAM
If god wanted us to use cell phones, he wouldn’t have invented cords.
70) SAM
Nah, just one sip of the demon broth and I’d end up drinking the whole thing.
71) SAM
That’s something.
72) SAM
Would you look at that?
73) SAM
Neat.
74) SAM
THAT won’t work.
75) SAM
Nope, don’t think so.
331) SAM
Nope, don’t think so.
76) SAM
Nah.
77) SAM
I’m not giving this away to just ANYBODY.
78) SAM
Are you guys ready to help us fight crime?
79) MOVIEFONE
We’re still on the search for new recruits!
80) SYNTH
IF YOU SPOT ANY UNUSED OFFICE EQUIPMENT, BE SURE TO HOOK A BROTHER UP.
81) BLEEPS
[like a wolf whistle] Bleep bloop!
82) SYNTH
DO NOT FORGET OUR SEMINAR ON WORKPLACE HARRASSMENT. PLUS I CALLED DIBS.
83) SAM
Any ideas on the case, COPS?
84) MOVIEFONE
We’re sorry, we haven’t been paying attention.
85) SYNTH
SCAN EVIDENCE WITH THE CRIME-TRON AND WE WILL TRACK DOWN THE VILLAINS WITHOUT MERCY.
86) HARRY-PHONE
[process phone] This is Harry Moleman, Speaker for the Dead. If you’d like a seance, exorcism, or Tibetan spirit-walking ritual, please leave a message and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can. I also do light secretarial or housework. [desperate]Please hire me.
87) SAM
That’s weird, Harry’s phone has been disconnected.
88) SAM
Skunkape must have been at a Meesta Pizza, but how can we know which one?
89) SAM
If Stinky went somewhere to meet Skunkape, she’s probably got the number of the place on speed dial.
90) SAM
This receipt’s only got part of an address, but not the name of the store.
91) SAM
I can make out part of the name of the store this came from, but no address.
92) SAM
Max, can’t you think of some way to let us move around the ship?
93) SAM
General Skunkape must’ve lost his homing beacon. I’d better give it back to him.
94) SAM
This spaceship could use some greenery to make it feel more lived-in.
95) SAM
Momma Bosco told me something about needing a remote control. I wish I’d been paying attention.
96) SAM
I wonder if Harry Moleman knows a way to get to the upper decks.
97) SAM
We’re going to need something dangerous and powerful to knock Skunkape into the Penal Zone.
98) SAM
That alien brain had all the answers. I bet he’d know what to do.
99) SAM
It’s going to take some real detective work to track down that missing power core.
100) SAM
I’d give 758 million dollars for some of that demon broth right about now.
101) SAM
With all the junk that piles up in our car, you’d think some of it would be useful right about now.
102) SAM
Agent Superball and I used to be so much closer. We should take some time to catch up.
103) SAM
General Skunkape could be anywhere in the city! He could’ve at least left a forwarding address, or a phone number.
104) SAM
Momma Bosco would be really helpful right about now, if we could just get into her lab.
105) SAM
Grandpa Stinky sounded like General Skunkape’s #1 biggest fan. I wonder if he can help.
106) SAM
We’re really close now, Max! We’ve just got to use our clues to track down where Skunkape’s going to show up next!
107) SAM
Use one of your freaky powers to get us out of here before that bomb goes off, Max!
108) SAM
No offense to Stinky, but in our future vision, Max and I had a PRIVATE cell.
109) SAM
I’ve got to get this homing beacon onto General Skunkape before we get accidentally incarcerated again.
110) SAM
Big things are going on underground, Max. I can feel it. If only we could find a way down there.
111) SAM
There’s got to be something in this city with the unholy power we need to power up this invention.
112) SAM
I don’t know how you stay comfortable, Max. It’s FREEZING in here.
113) SAM
I’d ask Skunkape if he knows what to do, but it looks like he’s got his hands full.
114) SAM
My second best and third most dangerous friend.
115) SAM
I already cleaned my gun today. Like I do every day. Religiously.
116) SAM
I don’t need to shoot anybody. It’s enough that they know I HAVE a gun.
117) SAM
No, that’d be a waste of bullets.

Checked the baby?
127) 
Yes
128) SAM
Why do we have jumper cables? Neither of us knows how to use ‘em.
129) MAX
It’s simple, Sam: the RED cable goes on the RIGHT nipple, and the BLACK cable clamps to the—
130) SAM
Neither of us knows how to use them LEGALLY, Max.
131) SAM
[pickup1] Pushing that button doesn’t do anything, now that the Penal Zone’s been wiped out.
132) MAX
[pickup1] Wait, wait... was that a setup for a dirty joke? I can’t even tell anymore.
133) SAM
[pickup1] It’s one of those obsolete all-in-one scanner/fax/copier/juicemaker machines.
134) SAM
[pickup1] It’s the note Flint Paper found, from the mysterious Mr. S to Stinky.
135) SAM
[reading] “Stinky my queen, I cannot wait any longer. I will be making my grand appearance this afternoon. You say they won’t trust me because I’m not human, but damn the consequences! We must start phase 2 of the operation NOW. I will call your private number with the details. Love, S.”
136) SAM
[reading] “P.S. Just to make sure... your private number is still 212-555-8942, isn’t it?”
137) SAM
[pickup1] I don’t need this thing. Maybe there’s someone around town looking for outdated office equipment.
138) SAM
[pickup1] It’s the cheap engagement ring Skunkape picked up for his new “queen.”
139) SAM
[pickup1] [context: giving engagement ring to someone] I’m not ready to commit.
140) SAM
[pickup1] Nah, but I bet somebody ELSE is looking for this obsolete thing.
141) SAM
[pickup1] Are you guys still looking for a fourth member?
142) SAM
[pickup1] There’s no space for it with those jumper cables in the back seat.
143) SYNTH
[pickup1] WELL, HELLO THERE, BEAUTIFUL. WERE YOUR MOVING PARTS PROPERLY SECURED WHEN YOU FELL FROM HEAVEN?
144) MOVIEFONE
[pickup1] After two items are inserted, our exclusive Clue-Match technology will scan for possible connections.
145) MOVIEFONE
[pickup1] ...it will reveal a new location on your map!
146) MAX
[pickup1] When, exactly, did this get really creepy?
147) MOVIEFONE
[pickup1] Thank you for joining us in a brand new style of 20th century crime fighting! You can begin submitting clues to the Crime-Tron whenever you find them!
148) MOVIEFONE
[pickup1] If we cannot recognize a piece, you’ll hear this:
149) BLEEPS
[pickup1] [negative beep] Blaat!
150) BLEEPS
[pickup1] [panicked bleeping] Bleep! Bleep! Bleep!
151) MOVIEFONE
[pickup1] Get that thing away from us.
152) SYNTH
[pickup1] IT IS TOO MUCH POWER. MY MIND IS GOING. I CAN FEEL IT. I CAN FEEL IT.
153) SAM
[pickup1] I don’t want to toss this thing around, I might break it.
154) SAM
[pickup1] I still need this! Besides, the contract explicitly says that the minutes are non-transferrable.
155) SAM
[pickup1] I’d better hang on to this.
156) SAM
[pickup1] Harry Moleman’s cell phone. No calls, no messages, no numbers. Sad, really.
157) SAM
[pickup1] This thing is too complicated. You’d have to be some kind of computer to figure it out.
158) SAM
[pickup1] This hard hat should only be used by people engaged in dangerous or questionable activity.
159) SAM
[pickup1] I’ve gotten attached to my own hat. Maybe somebody else can use it.
160) SAM
[pickup1] I’d better keep this. It could be an important clue in our case!
161) SAM
[pickup1] It’s Skunkape’s Penal Zone prisoner’s badge, with built-in homing beacon.
162) SAM
[pickup1] It says right here in the instructions, “only useable by mole men.”
163) SAM
[pickup1] This thing could be worth millions! I’d better be more careful with it.
164) SAM
[pickup1] Nah, I’m going to need this thing to trap Skunkape.
165) SAM
[pickup1] Nah, this thing is useless now that the Penal Zone’s been blown up.
166) SAM
[pickup1] Now that the Penal Zone’s been blown up, this thing is useless.
167) SAM
[pickup1] Nah, this broth stuff is too important to waste.
168) SAM
[pickup1] It sounded like Grandpa Stinky’s demon broth is powerful enough to wake the dead!
169) SAM
[pickup1] Nah, I’d better save this for somebody who needs a jolt.
170) SAM
[pickup1] I can’t plug a rift generator into THAT.
171) SAM
[pickup1] I better keep this note. There could be valuable information on it.
172) SAM
[pickup1] Skunkape got this ring from SOMEwhere, but the engraving just says, “Hard Luck.”
173) SAM
[pickup1] This postcard is from somebody who collects and sells vintage toys and family heirlooms.
174) MOVIEFONE
[pickup1] I’m perfectly capable of making phone calls without that, thank you.
175) MAX
[pickup1] What am I supposed to do with THAT? You’re the one with the pockets.
176) MAX
[pickup1] [context: Sam tried to give him something, emphasis on “I”] I don’t want it.
177) SAM
[pickup1] Well, you heard the me, little buddy. We’ve got to find some demon broth, and Momma Bosco’s futuristic power core!
178) MOVIEFONE
[pickup1] You’ve discovered a new location!
179) SYNTH
[pickup1] SCAN COMPLETE. NEW LOCATION UNLOCKED.
180) MOVIEFONE
[pickup1] Success! A new destination has been revealed on your map!
181) SYNTH
[pickup1] ITEM NOT FOUND IN DATABASE.
182) SYNTH
[pickup1] ITEM NOT RECOGNIZED.
183) MAX
[pickup1] I can’t seem to remember that phone number right now, Sam!
184) MAX
[pickup1] I don’t want to go there now, and you can’t make me!
185) MAX
[pickup1]Hey, my psychic power didn’t work! Must be a dramatically convenient sunspot nearby.
186) 
Hang up
187) MOVIEFONE
Congratulations! You’ve unlocked a secret toy surprise!
188) SYNTH
WE HAVE PINPOINTED THE LOCATION OF THE NEW TOY ON YOUR MAP. YOU ARE WELCOME.
189) SAM
[pickup3] Simmer down, Max! Check out Stinky’s cell phone: we’re going to need that and your creepy new brain powers to get OUT of this cage!
190) SAM
Any ideas, Max?
191) MAX
A field mouse detective two days from retirement teams up with a rookie peregrine falcon to stop a serial killer. I call it “A Prey and a Winger.” Hour-long drama, possible mid-season replacement.
192) SAM
Any ideas how to send Skunkape back to the Penal Zone?
193) MAX
Hmm... well, I DO have psychic powers.
194) SAM
Do you remember the “What to Do in Case of Alien Invasion” checklist, little buddy?
195) MAX
Oh, I KNOW this! 1) Interrogate the alien leader. 2) Liberate any horrific experimental creatures trapped on their spaceship.
196) SAM
Aaaaannnnd...?
197) MAX
Oh! 3) Trick them into believing that cat litter is the official Earth currency!
198) SAM
Then sit back and watch hilarity ensue. Good work, Max!
199) SAM
Where are we supposed to find demon broth?
200) MAX
I always make my own. Putting a fresh demon in the stock gives it a homemade taste you just can’t find in restaurants.
201) SAM
Can you use your freakish mind powers to MAKE Grandpa Stinky give us that demon broth?
202) MAX
That depends. How important is it that his head doesn’t explode?
203) SAM
That’d be a deal-breaker. You should practice on inanimate objects first.
204) SAM
Have you heard from Momma Bosco lately?
205) MAX
Not since she moved across town. Things got complicated after I broke up with her.
206) SAM
You didn’t break up with her, we traveled through time and then she died and became a ghost.
207) MAX
Like I said: complicated.
208) SAM
What’s Flint Paper been doing while our building’s being renovated?
209) MAX
I heard he’s been busting up street gangs, taking out mob bosses, and now he’s eating every item off Stinky’s menu!
210) SAM
Uh oh, he’s crossed the line from “reckless” to “death wish.”
211) SAM
Why would Stinky team up with General Skunkape?
212) MAX
You know women. Won’t give nice guys the time of day, but as soon as the “hairy, evil, intergalactic warlord” type calls, they come running.
213) SAM
How do you hook up a power core and an alien brain?
214) MAX
You can’t rush it, Sam. Get them alone together in the back seat of a car, and just let nature take its course.
215) SAM
What are we supposed to be doing, again?
216) MAX
Something about an alien brain, wasn’t it? I see the future, Sam. I’m not so good with the present.
217) SAM
You ever worry that your future vision was just a big misunderstanding, and Skunkape turns out to be a good guy after all?
218) MAX
Worrying is for lesser creatures, Sam. I’m a highly advanced psychic being, the next stage in our evolution.
219) SAM
Well, when you put it like that, I can’t help but be even more terrified.
220) SAM
Does your family have a history of psychic powers, Max?
221) MAX
No, my old Papa Maximus always believed in the old-fashioned ways to set things on fire or make them explode.
222) SAM
Didn’t you have a bunch of cool psychic powers in your future vision?
223) MAX
[realizing] Yeah! That stupid brain must be holding out on us!
224) SAM
Where do you think Stinky ran off to?
225) MAX
To confession, if she knows what’s good for her soul.
226) SAM
Not everybody’s embraced religion like you have, Max.
227) MAX
I’ve got Father McCallister on speed dial!
228) SAM
You think the COPS’s cheesy new crime computer idea will actually work?
229) MAX
Probably not, but what’s the worst that could happen?
230) SAM
It sends us off to some dead end alley in the worst part of the city, where we get eaten by a cannibal street gang who feeds the leftovers to mutant sewer sharks and then we get cancer.
231) MAX
I don’t see how you can be so grouchy in a city with cannibal street gangs AND mutant sewer sharks.
232) SAM
Do you think we have what it takes to join the Skunkape Army?
233) MAX
I think you could use a good stomach workout, Sam. Lose weight the Stinky way.
234) SAM
Purging does tighten up those abs, I’ll give you that.
235) SAM
Do you think we should tell Harry Moleman’s family about his... err, “vacation”?
236) MAX
Depends on whether you think he left us anything in his... err, “Last Will and Testament.”
237) SAM
How are we going to get inside Momma Bosco’s lab?
238) MAX
Try the fire escape!
239) SAM
What good will that do?
240) MAX
Probably nothing. But then you can throw yourself off the roof in a fit of despair.
241) SAM
How are we going to catch a rogue alien?
242) MAX
Why not ask Agent Superball? I think he’s one of them. I’ve never seen his belly button!
243) SAM
You’ve never seen MY belly button, either.
244) MAX
Let’s keep it that way, Sam, or whatever your real name is.
245) SAM
Are you sure that future vision of yours works? We’re supposed to be winning!
246) MAX
Maybe they’re just rose-tinted future vision glasses.
247) SAM
What do we do now, Max? General Skunkape’s trying to kill us with lasers and spite!
248) MAX
He can tear up our neighborhood, but he’ll never kill us! [confidentially] We’re the heroes of the game, Sam.
249) SAM
I think you’re over-estimating our marketability, little pal.
250) SAM
Feel like going back on board Skunkape’s spaceship?
251) MAX
It’s the perfect time to attack! He’s humiliated and beaten us so many times, he must be feeling over-confident!
252) SAM
Where are we going to get enough power to turn on Momma Bosco’s dimensional rift whosiwhatsit?
253) MAX
True power comes from within, Sam.
254) SAM
From within what?
255) MAX
Reactors, generators, batteries, turbines, ancient artifacts... lots of things.
256) SAM
What do we do now?
257) MAX
Just keep trying stuff. You’ll figure it out eventually.
258) SAM
It’s like a sauna in here!
259) MAX
[worried] I can’t take much more of this, Sam! I’m already as naked as I know how to be!
260) SAM
I can’t believe all the wacky hijinx that led to this climactic showdown!
261) MAX
It’ll probably be more believable once we’ve seen it all in order.
262) SAM
It feels good to be on a case again!
263) MAX
Now, is it really a “case” if we don’t have a client and no one’s paying us?
264) SAM
The client is Justice, Max, and Justice is blind and frugal.
265) SAM
Now all kinds of bad guys are going to be after your eerie powers and your freakish body.
266) MAX
Tell ‘em to get in line. I’ve got all kinds of ladies trying to get a piece of this body.
267) SAM
I already explained that, Max. Those ladies want you for cosmetics testing.
268) SAM
I sure hope those psychic powers aren’t a danger to the people you work on or around, Max.
269) MAX
Whenever I use them, it feels like somebody’s microwaving a radar gun near a high tension wire in my skull.
270) SAM
It’s a good thing neither of us is legally, morally, or ethically allowed to reproduce.
271) SAM
Sybil sent us a postcard! She and the giant stone head of Abraham Lincoln are still on their extended honeymoon.
272) MAX
And you said their marriage wouldn’t last.
273) SAM
Actually, I said it was a violation of the laws of nature and most major religions.
274) SAM
I’m surprised and disappointed that you managed to stay President this long.
275) MAX
Yeah, that sudden, unexplained outbreak of bubonic plague really brought the nation together for my re-election.
276) SAM
That reminds me, where’s Jimmy Two-Teeth and all his rat pals?
277) MAX
Damnedest thing: they suddenly came into a lot of money from an anonymous benefactor.
278) SAM
I hope they finish the repair work on our building soon. I miss taking showers.
279) MAX
We could just give ourselves tongue baths, like cats and flight attendants do!
280) SAM
Well... okay, I guess. Just be careful around the back of my neck, that’s where I’m most prone to tie rash.
281) SAM
The city looks a lot different from what I remember.
282) MAX
It’s the new Mayor and his “Man Up, New York! It’s a City, Not a Freakin’ Day Care Center” Campaign.
283) SAM
His inauguration was the most action-packed in years, though.
284) MAX
He wore a necklace made from human fingers!
285) SAM
I wonder what it’d be like to live on another planet.
286) MAX
Probably a lot like this one, but bouncier. And more methane-rich.
287) SAM
I don’t need to go to another planet for a methane-rich environment, as long as I’ve got you, pal.
288) MAX
That’s really sweet and obvious, Sam.
289) 
Alien brain
290) SAM
How do you suppose we bring our alien brain friend back to life?
291) MAX
I’m sure you’ll figure something out eventually.
292) SAM
I don’t have that kind of patience, little buddy.
293) MAX
What do you want, Sam? It’s not like I can see the fut— oh, wait.
294) SAM
I sure hope that alien brain appreciates all the trouble we’re going through to bring him back to life.
295) MAX
Eh, you know how those intellectuals are. He’ll probably start bragging that he doesn’t own a TV.
296) 
Skunkape
297) SAM
If we don’t stop him, General Skunkape’s going to destroy the whole city!
298) MAX
Yeah, let’s wait until he’s done with Queens. I’m getting pretty tired of their attitude.
299) SAM
How are we going to knock General Skunkape back into the Penal Zone?
300) MAX
[singing] If you’re an evil space gorilla and you know it, clap your hands!
301) MAX
This fiend is more clever than we ever imagined.
302) SAM
I sure hope the planet doesn’t fall for General Skunkape’s plan. Whatever it is.
303) MAX
Well, he IS pretty charismatic, Sam. And he’s from space, which is a plus.
304) MAX
But you’re the only hairy, overweight, domineering control freak I need, Sam.
305) SAM
[sincere, then skeptical] Gee, thanks, Max. I think.
306) SAM
Skunkape could be anywhere in the city!
307) MAX
He’s a muscle-bound thug with a weird accent and excessive back hair. He should be easy to spot, at least until we get to the Bronx.
308) SAM
After that, we’d need some kind of computer to find him!
309) SAM
I wonder where General Skunkape ran off to.
310) MAX
He’s probably doing what everybody does their first time in New York.
311) SAM
Teaming up with loose women and going on a city-wide search for magic psychic toys?
312) MAX
There’s a reason it’s such a cliche, Sam.
313) SAM
I can’t wait to get rid of that Skunkape jerk once and for all!
314) MAX
But if he’s the big bad guy, what would we do after we beat him?
315) SAM
Well... we could let him out every few weeks and beat him up some more!
316) 
Max
317) SAM
My memory’s fuzzy, but I’m pretty sure this is all your fault, Max.
318) MAX
What can I say, Sam? Alien ships love to abduct me. It’s not my fault I look so probeable.
319) SAM
These psychic powers of yours are pretty neat.
320) MAX
[disappointed] I guess. It’s just too bad I didn’t have them on prom night.
321) SAM
Cheer up, pal! Just think of all the destruction you can cause at the class reunion.
322) SAM
Don’t worry, little buddy. I won’t let anything bad or overly deadly happen to you.
323) MAX
You’re my best friend, Sam! I know you’d take a bullet for me!
324) SAM
Well... I’d at least be very rude to the guy who shot you.
325) 
Bye
326) SAM
Keep watching the skies, Max.
327) MAX
I’ll shoot if they try anything funny.
328) SAM
See ya, Max.
329) MAX
Keep in touch!
330) MOVIEFONE
Place any two pieces of evidence into the Crime-Tron XL multi-scanner.
332) MAX
Sam, {confused} where do you think that mole man went?
333) 
Alien invasion
334) 
What now?
337) 
What now?
339) 
What now?
335) 
Worried?
336) 
Psychic history?
338) 
Future vision?
340) 
It’s hot!
341) 
I’m confused!
342) 
New case!
343) 
Psychic powers!
344) 
Psychic powers!
345) 
Sybil
346)

347)

348) 
New York
349) 
Other planets
350) MAX
Let’s take the DeSoto for a spin, Sam. I want to see what evil the COPS have wrought.
351) MAX
Let’s go talk to Momma Bosco! I respect her because she’s smart, sassy, and semi-transparent.
352) MAX
I can’t believe Skunkape lets us just walk into his ship unsupervised. It’s like he’s never even met us.
353) 
Nope
354) SAM
A screwdriver, the kind used for screwing and unscrewing.
355) SAM
I really don’t want to screw that.
