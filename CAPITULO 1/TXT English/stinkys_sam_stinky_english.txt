1) STINKY
{sarcastic}[distracted] Oh, hi, Barney and Jug-Jug.
2) MAX
{incredulous}“Barney and Jug-Jug”? {suspicious}You’re not even TRYING with the names anymore, are you?
3) STINKY
Look, I’ve got a lot going on. {sarcastic}Can I just give you your key, or your crystal shard, or {normal}whatever it is you’re looking for, so you guys can go off and do{suspicious} whatever it is you do?
4) SAM
{worried}Sorry, Stinky. We’ve gotta go through all the questions. It’s the rules.
5) STINKY
{disgusted}Whatever.
6) STINKY
{suspicious}Are you still here?
7) SAM
{confused}Okay let’s see... {normal}I’ll take a double bacon cheddar butter deluxe, heavy on the wacky sauce. Two orders of the jalapeno cheesy poofters, Rhode Island style.
8) STINKY
{sarcastic}I’m on break.
9) MAX
{surprised}No! Three!
10) MAX
{aloof}Small side salad, please. {happy}Oh! And some bangers and mash. {aloof}HOLD the mash.
11) SAM
Okay, three. And let’s throw in one of the eight bean casseroles with extra onion rings,{enthused} and finish it off with a jumbo-sized frosty banana mint pickle cyclone chugger, with extra jimmies.
12) STINKY
{sarcastic}[covering up] You boys must be mistaken. It’s always been just me here, working the kitchen, no one else. [trying to sound sincere]That’s why I’m so grateful Grandpa Stinky’s back.
13) MAX
{confused}Yeah, what was his name? Sal or Pablo or Mohammed or something?
14) SAM
{confused}What happened to your fry cook?
15) STINKY
Nope, haven’t seen it. Momma Bosco would know about that kind of thing.{suspicious} I mean... I’m guessing.
16) SAM
[context: what does it look like?] Futuristic.
17) MAX
{aloof}[context: what does it look like?] Core-shaped. Kind of power-ish.
18) SAM
You haven’t seen a futuristic power core around here, have you?
19) STINKY
{sarcastic}[denial] What? No, of course not! [trying to recover] Uh... what does it look like?
20) STINKY
{disgusted}Look at what he’s doing to the place! He’s totally destroying the ambience.
21) MAX
SIX senses, Sam! {sarcastic}You always had the uncanny premonition of severe stomach upset in your future.
22) SAM
{sarcastic}Yeah, this place USED to be an aggravated assault on all five senses. {normal}Now it’s just a misdemeanor battery.
23) SAM
Things must be easier now that Grandpa Stinky’s back...
24) STINKY
{sarcastic}[sarcastic] Oh, yes, it’s heaven.
25) STINKY
{sarcastic}[very sinister] Oh, I don’t think Grandpa Stinky is going to be a problem {disgusted}for much longer.
26) MAX
{realizing}Intriguing!
27) STINKY
{cocky}[matter of factly] I signed us up for relationship counseling and a business management seminar.
28) SAM
You and Grandpa Stinky should patch things up. {worried}Can’t you see what it’s doing to Max?
29) MAX
{sad}[disappointed] Oh.
30) MAX
{sad}[eyes shut, throwing a tantrum] I hate it when they fight.
31) SAM
{worried}The aliens have landed!
32) STINKY
{suspicious}[lying] Oh... really? I haven’t heard anything about that at all.
33) SAM
{Stern}Keep your guard up, we’re about 99.8% sure he’s evil.
34) SAM
See you again soon, Stinky!
35) STINKY
{disgusted}[cold shoulder] Yeah. Take your time.
36) MAX
{realizing}[back to normal] Oh, I thought we were doing “good cop, incontinent cop.”
37) SAM
{confused}What was that all about, Max?
38) SAM
{stern}What can you tell us about this note, Stinky?
39) STINKY
{suspicious}[paranoid] Where did you find that? [recovering] {cocky}I mean... I’ve never seen that before.
40) MAX
{worried}[has to go to the bathroom] Hurry up and tell us right now I gotta go real bad oh god please hurry I don’t think I can hold it!
41) SAM
{confused}This note is signed “S.” Want to tell us who that is?
42) STINKY
{sarcastic}Could be anybody. Sybil, Superball, Santa, the Shambling Corporate Presence, Satan, the Statue Head of Abraham Lincoln...
43) MAX
{sarcastic}Salma Hayek, Screamin’ Jay Hawkins...
44) SAM
{Stern}You’re not helping the interrogation, Max.
45) STINKY
{disgusted}Do you guys mind? I’m waiting for an important phone call.
46) MAX
{cocky}[scandalous] He’s not even human!
