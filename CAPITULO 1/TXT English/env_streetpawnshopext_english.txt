1) MAX
{sarcastic}The intergalactic warlord business must be in a real slump if Skunkape is having to hit the pawn shops.
2) SAM
He’s tracking down magic toys, Max. And he must’ve found something inside if he left gruesome there to guard the door.
3) MAX
{realizing}Intrigue!
4) SAM
I have GOT to get a better ammo supplier one of these days.
5) SAM
{sarcastic}Oldest trick in the book!
6) SAM
Just a bunch of food scraps and used cat litter. It’d help if I knew what I was looking for.
7) SAM
A-ha! A banana peel!
8) SAM
Freelance Police, pal. {Stern}Let us in.
9) MINION2
{angry}Go ‘way.
10) SAM
Hmm, a vintage postcard from somebody who collects old, rare toys.
11) MAX
What’s the address?
12) SAM
I don’t know, Max. The name and most of the address are smudged out. This looks like a job for the Crime-Tron!
13) SAM
This goes deep into the fiery bowels of America’s filthiest city.
14) MAX
You’ve been listening to my inner bathroom narration again.
15) SAM
This looks entirely too safe.
16) SAM
{stern}[defensive] I could’ve totally carried that heavy thing a lot farther. I just didn’t feel like it.
17) SAM
I think that manhole cover is perfect right where it is.
18) MAX
Don’t be embarrassed, Sam. {happy}You have an inner strength that outshines your frail and infant-like physical weakness.
19) SAM
{stern}[to attract attention] Down with Skunkape! Aliens go home!
20) MINION2
{angry}[angry] Hey!
21) MINION2
{normal}[calmly] You guys really shouldn’t be littering.
22) MAX
{happy}Surprise!
23) SAM
Seems like a waste of a perfectly good banana peel.
24) SAM
This just goes upstairs to the apartments.
25) MAX
{happy}Maybe we should go up and interrogate the locals!
26) SAM
{worried}Those people live above a pawn shop, Max. They’ve already suffered enough.
27) MAX
My psychic gifts tell me those trash cans are going to be useful later.
28) SAM
{enthused}Would you like to know what magical surprises are in your future? My friend here is a trained psychic.
29) MINION2
Beat it.
30) MAX
{aloof}[Jamaican accent] Call me now for your free reading!
31) SAM
{enthused}[tempting] Mmmm... a banana. It’s nature’s cheesecake. Isn’t it time for your lunch break, buddy?
32) MINION2
{Angry}Scram.
33) MINION2
{angry}And throw that thing away. It’s dangerous.
34) SAM
Looks like Skunkape gave us the slip, and left gruesome here to take the fall.
35) SAM
{worried}This whole block smells like a sewer.
36) MAX
{surprised}[context: don’t blame me!] Don’t look at me!

[pickup1] Jerks.

[pickup1] Nah, we should really get going. Plus it smells in there.

46) SAM
65 percent oxygen, 18 percent carbon, 10 percent hydrogen... Well, ain’t that a stitch! These alien gorillas share the same elemental composition as you and me!
47) MAX
[pickup1] Speak for yourself, Sam. I have wayyyyyy more bismuth than those stupid apes.
48) SAM
[pickup1] [reading] Vitamin B6, vitamin C, potassium, and 82% of the recommended daily allowance of slapstick comedy.
49) MAX
[pickup1] Maybe, but the comedy is way, way past its freshness date.
50) MAX
[pickup1] What do you think I am, Sam, a rookie? [smug] I believe I know how— whoa!
51) SAM
[pickup1] Be careful around this banana peel, Max.
52) SAM
[pickup1] [sarcastic] You’d think the one with future vision would’ve seen that coming.
53) SAM
[pickup1] [reading] “Hard Luck Pawn Shop.”
54) MAX
[pickup1] Oh, good! This is the place where I hocked your baby shoes, your first bicycle, your retainer... They know me here!
55) SAM
[pickup1] I think one of us should try to smash through that window with his rock-hard, melon-sized head.
56) MAX
[pickup1] And I think one of us should try the door, unless he wants to spend the rest of the day picking plate glass out of his partner’s fluffy white nether regions.
57) SAM
[pickup1] No, no, no. See, the idea here is that we SOLVE the puzzles.
58) 
banana peel
59) SAM
[pickup1] I hate to have to do this, Max, but it’s the only way to save the city!
60) MAX
[pickup1] What the heck was THAT all about?
61) SAM
[pickup1] No clue, Max. Your future visions need an index or something.
62) SAM
Skunkape must’ve tossed it out when he realized it wasn’t magical. We’ve gotta find what store he got it from.
63) MAX
A paddle ball toy?
