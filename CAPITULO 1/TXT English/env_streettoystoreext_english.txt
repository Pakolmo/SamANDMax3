{stern} Shut up, Max. They’re completely different streets.
2) MAX
How are we ever gonna find Skunkape, Sam? {incredulous} All these streets look the same!
3) HARRY

31) HARRY
{scared} It’s mole men! General Skun-ka’pe is sweating mole men!
4) MAX
[annoyed] {suspicious} Uh, SPOILER WARNING, Harry! Sheesh.
5) MAX
We can’t leave now! Skunkape’s gonna be here any second!

11) SAM
[pickup1] Just think Max, one of these innocent-looking toys may hold the key to unlocking another terrifying psychic power.
12) MAX
[pickup1] I bet it’s the giraffe. I don’t trust anything with a longer neck than mine.
13) SAM
[pickup1] I can’t tell... the Nutri-Specs are having a hard time seeing through all the lead paint.
14) MAX
[pickup1] Well? Which toy is full of spooky psychic mojo?
15) SAM
[pickup1][reading]“Bob’s Toys!s”
16) MAX
[pickup1] The extra S is for “Sorry About the Misspelled Sign.”
17) SAM
[pickup1] In the future, all these toys are still here, unbought and unloved. That’s kind of sad.
18) MAX
[pickup1] It’s their own fault for not being more fun. It’s not a welfare state, Sam.
19) MAX
[pickup1] What are we going to do once he shows up?
20) SAM
[pickup1] Hmm, I don’t know yet.

[pickup3] A-ha! New York’s lackadaisical business hours win again!
25) SAM
[pickup3] But Skunkape will be back any second, little buddy. {stern}We’d better be ready for him!
26) SAM
[pickup3] Skunkape’s either waiting for this place to open, or coming back with his goons to bust the door down.
27) SAM
It’s locked.
