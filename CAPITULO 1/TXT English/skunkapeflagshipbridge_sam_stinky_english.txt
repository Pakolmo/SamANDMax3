1) STINKY
{suspicious} Sam and Max? Don’t tell me Skun-ka’pe wants YOU guys to be his love slaves, too?
2) MAX
{sarcastic} You’d be surprised just how many fetishes there are that involve Sam and me.
3) SAM
{confused} What are you doing locked in here, Stinky?
4) STINKY
{cocky} I’ve got no idea. I assumed it was Grandpa Stinky’s fault.
5) STINKY
{disgusted} Ugh. Hang on a second.
6) STINKY
[annoyed] {disgusted} “I M U R LUV MONKEE.” Yes, hi, Skun-ka’pe. I see you. That’s very clever. [to Sam & Max]{suspicious}He’s been texting me non-stop. I tried to throw the phone away just to get away from it.
7) SAM
Did you lose your cell ph—? [cut off]
8) SAM
Can you call for help on your fancy futuristic phone?
9) STINKY
{sarcastic} I already tried that when you guys were knocked out. {disgusted}There’s no signal off this spaceship.
10) 
Skunkape’s not so bad
11) 
Skunkape’s a jerk!
12) SAM
{confused} Why aren’t you out there on your throne?
13) MAX
{confused} Yeah, isn’t Skunkape your boyfriend?
14) STINKY
{disgusted} Eww. He wishes. He is SO not my type. You only have to date an evil gorilla once to learn never to make THAT mistake again.
15) MAX
{cocky} Oh, we’ve all been there, girlfriend.
16) SAM
{confused} How is this Grandpa Stinky’s fault?
17) STINKY
{disgusted} He’s been going on and on about Skun-ka’pe ever since he landed. {sarcastic}“THAT’s the kind of gentleman you should get involved with.” “HE’s got a future.” {disgusted}Ugh.
18) SAM
{stern} You’ve got to stay away from Skunkape! {incredulous} The guy’s a total butt horn.
19) STINKY
{sarcastic} You’re telling me! {cocky} I was just going to meet my... to meet a friend at the top of the Empire State Building. Then all of a sudden this giant gorilla shows up and carries me off to be his queen or something.
20) SAM
{stern} Gee, you’d think a hyper-intelligent alien could’ve come up with something more original.
21) MAX
{suspicious} I’m not buying this “super-advanced technology” business if they haven’t even mastered the technique of margaritas and unexpected car trouble.
22) STINKY
{disgusted} Whatever. Let me know if you’ve got any brilliant ideas.
23) SAM
You’ve got to help us take care of that jerk, Skunkape.
24) SAM
I think you’re being too hard on Skunkape. {sarcastic}He’s just misunderstood.
25) STINKY
{cocky} Oh yeah? Did I “misunderstand” this picture he sent me?
26) SAM
[shocked] {surprised} Good heavens!
27) MAX
[shocked, quietly] {Scared} I think I should put on some clothes now.
28) SAM
{incredulous} Well, Skunkape’s got a lot of good points, too.
29) STINKY
{Stern} Name one.
30) SAM
Yeah, you got me. I can’t think of any.
31) SAM
{sarcastic} He’s super-strong!
32) SAM
{incredulous} He must be pretty smart, being from an advanced alien culture and all.
33) SAM
{happy} He’s got that effortless charm.
34) SKUNKAPE
{evil} Die, Earthlings! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
35) MAX
{happy} And a gentle, carefree laugh like a warm summer’s day.
36) SAM
He’s got his own spaceship!
37) STINKY
{disgusted} I noticed. That may impress you boys, but...
38) MAX
{worried} But then she wouldn’t be able to talk to us anymore!
39) STINKY
[sing-song] {cocky} Yoo-hoo, General Skun-ka’pe!
40) STINKY
{disgusted} That kind of thing may impress Sybil, but it doesn’t do anything for me.
41) MAX
{happy} And he deflects bullets!
42) STINKY
{suspicious} Gee, it sounds like YOU two should go out with him. Would you like me to give you guys some privacy?
43) SAM
{sarcastic} Well, to be fair, she does lead people on.
44) STINKY
[sarcastic] {suspicious} Oh yeah, he’s a genius. He spent an hour trying to hit on the Statue of Liberty before his minions convinced him it was a statue.
45) MAX
{suspicious} Waving that torch around, inviting strangers up in her crown. {sarcastic}She’s asking for it.
46) STINKY
[insincere] {seatedthrone} Oh, great! You’ll have to catch up with me later and tell me how you did it.
47) SAM
Don’t worry, Stinky! {sarcastic} We made it out okay!
48) SAM
{confused} Any idea how we can beat Skunkape?
49) STINKY
{seatedthrone} Aren’t you guys supposed to be detectives or something? I thought you’d be used to figuring these things out.
50) MAX
{sarcastic} We tend to focus on wacky and irreverent hijinks over the actual detective work.
51) SAM
[loudly] {angry} You’ll live to regret betraying us, “Queen” Stinky!
55) SAM
[loudly] {angry} You’ll live to regret betraying us, “Queen” Stinky!
52) STINKY
{seatedthrone} You’re no match for General Skun-ka’pe, Sam & Max! When he’s done, the world will never have to listen to your idiotic nonsense ever again!
53) STINKY
{seatedthrone} You’re no match for General Skun-ka’pe, Sam & Max! When he’s done, the world will never have to listen to your idiotic nonsense ever again!
54) MAX
[loudly] {angry} Soon you’ll be serving TIME instead of serving BAD FOOD... in the Penal Zone!
56) SAM
[quieter] {happy} Nice performance, Stinky! I think Skunkape believed it!
57) STINKY
Oh, uh, right. “Performance.”
58) SAM
[sarcastic] {sarcastic} Don’t bother getting up, Stinky.
59) MAX
{cocky} Yeah, we got this.
60) 
Stinky
61) 
Grandpa Stinky
62) 
Cell phone
63) 
Bye
64) SAM
Stay strong, Stinky.
65) MAX
{cocky} You gotta keep a cool head when you’re in the joint.
66) STINKY
{suspicious} I liked it better when you guys were unconscious.
67) 
Strength
68) 
Intelligence
69) 
Charm
70) 
Spaceship
71) 
Never mind
72) SAM
[pickup1] ...and the keys to your cage, so he could let you out.
73) SAM
[pickup1] We’re all set, Max! Now we’ve just got to get out of this cage so we can wrap this case up once and for all!
