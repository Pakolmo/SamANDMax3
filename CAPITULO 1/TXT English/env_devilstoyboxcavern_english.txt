[reverent chanting] Ooooooooommmmmmmmmm...
2) CULTIST2
{normal}Uh, excuse me... I’m pretty sure you mean tablet 6, verse 24.
3) CULTIST1
[reverent chanting] Ooooooooo...
4) CULTIST1
{stern}[angry] Intruders! They’ve come to defile the Toybox!
5) CULTIST1
{stern}[angry] Heretic!
6) SAM
{sarcastic}You try and entertain the OTHER wing nuts {normal}while I find a way to power this thing up.
7) CULTIST2
{stern}KILL THEM! {surprised}No, wait, brother! Look! It is the dog and rabbit!
8) MAX
{sarcastic}We’re in so many prophecies we should start charging royalties.
9) SAM
Looks like another in a long line of wacky cults, Max.
10) MAX
{angry}Could you guys keep it down? We’re trying to save the planet here.
11) CULTIST1
{surprised}[awestruck] Just as prophesied on tablet 8, verse 32!
12) SAM
{worried}That’s the most evil-looking toy chest I’ve ever seen!
13) CULTIST2
{surprised}That would give General Skun-ka’pe unimaginable power to destroy us all!
14) SAM
{worried}No doubt it’d unleash all kinds of horrors if we ever opened it.
15) SAM
{happy}And I’ll scrounge up some blasting caps!
16) CULTIST1
{surprised}No! You mustn’t open it!
17) MAX
{happy}I’ll get a crowbar!
18) SAM
{worried}[disappointed] They’re right, pal. We’d better get rid of Skunkape first.
19) SAM
The power’s out in the whole building.
20) SAM
Well, it’s plugged in. But there’s not enough power to turn it on.
21) SAM
That should be enough power. Now to turn it on.
22) SAM
{confused}I can’t turn it on. There’s no power.
23) SAM
First I need to get this homing beacon onto Skunkape, {worried}or else I’LL get sucked in again.
24) MAX
{sarcastic}Doing that twice in one day would just be humiliating.
25) SKUNKAPE
{happy}Ha ha ha ha! Well played, Sam & Max! {evil}But once again I’m too strong, and you have only seconds before...
26) SKUNKAPE
{surprised}[surprised] Wait! It can’t be! The Devil’s Toybox?
27) SAM
{confused}[never heard of it] Devil’s Toybox?
28) MAX
{angry}Yeah, go find your own toys.
29) SKUNKAPE
{happy}Ha ha ha, perfect! {proud}You have led me right to the greatest prize of all! {evil}Soon your bothersome dimensional rift will close, and I will take the toybox AND the one who can control it! YES!
30) MAX
{worried}Think of something quick, Sam. I don’t like the way he’s undressing me with his eyes.
31) SAM
There’s no place on the toybox to plug this in.
32) SAM
{Stern}Give up, Skunkape. You’re under arrest.
108) SAM
{Stern}Give up, Skunkape. You’re under arrest.
33) SKUNKAPE
{happy}Ha ha ha, under arrest? {confused}By an Earth dog and his pitiful inventions?
34) SKUNKAPE
{angry}I have more strength in one hand than in {evil}all the inventions of your planet’s greatest scientists!
35) SAM
{stern}Just stop fighting so we can hurry this thing up already. I’ve got places to be.
36) SKUNKAPE
{cocky}Give up now? When I’m so close to having ALL of the toys? {angry}Nonsense!
37) SAM
As soon as this case is over, I’m getting a gun with more gorilla-stopping power.
38) SAM
Pretty sloppy of you to miss this toy, Skunkape. It’s the best one yet!
39) SKUNKAPE
Nonsense! It’s worthless.
40) SAM
Are you kidding me? It’s just dripping with psychic power. Right, Max?
41) MAX
[faking it] Huh? Oh, right. That one gives me the power to... uh... automatically calculate the proper tip at restaurants.
42) SAM
Nice one, bonehead.
43) MAX
It’s a very practical power, Sam. They can’t all be show-stoppers.
44) SKUNKAPE
Give it to me! NOW!
45) SAM
[taunting] Betcha can’t get it from me!
46) SKUNKAPE
Arrggh!
47) SAM
{happy}[taunting] Keep away from the big monkey!
107) SAM
{happy}[taunting] Keep away from the big monkey!
48) SKUNKAPE
{angry}No fair, give it!
49) NARRATOR
{arrogant}And so our heroes save the world once again, {normal}our villain undone by his own greed. It would seem {Stern}a fitting conclusion.
50) NARRATOR
{stern}But this is not the end—{arrogant}oh, no—{stern}but merely a beginning. {arrogant}The overture, if you will, of a five-part symphony of mayhem that will {Stern}BLOW YOUR EVER-LOVING MIND.
51) NARRATOR
{normal}What is this mysterious toybox, with its bizarre connection to Max? Is General Skun-ka’pe truly defeated? {arrogant}Will Sam ever find true love? {Stern}Will Max be able to control his emerging powers, or are his ominous visions of the future a sign of tragedy to come?
52) NARRATOR
{normal}I’ll see you in the coming chapters to answer all of these questions, {arrogant}and more! But for now, I leave you with this chilling conclusion:
53) SAM
{normal}Ouch! {enthused}Sucked right through three floors and a septic tank!
54) MAX
{incredulous}There goes our security deposit.
55) SAM
{confused}I wonder if our building is zoned to act as an interdimensional prison... [trails off, notices something]
56) MAX
{incredulous}Sam, {worried}what are they looking at?
109) MAX
{incredulous}Sam, {worried}what are they looking at?
57) SAM
{surprised}Holy heaping helpings of Herodotus on bass with Marshall stacks and a wah-wah pedal!
58) MAX
{scared}Is that... US?!
59) SAM
{sarcastic}The workers left some of the cable exposed when they were busy {stern}not fixing the power in this dump.
60) SAM
Well, it’s worth a shot. Hey Max, want to come here and ground me?
110) SAM
Well, it’s worth a shot. Hey Max, want to come here and ground me?
61) MAX
{incredulous}You’re pushing 40 in dog years, you’re not a very good detective, and it looks like you’ve put on weight.
62) SAM
Thanks, that should do it.
63) SAM
Now I should be able to turn on that rift transmogrifier or whatever.
64) CULTIST1
{Stern}[angry] Turn it off!
65) CULTIST2
{stern}Cut it out! We live in cool, dark places!
106) CULTIST2
{stern}Cut it out! We live in cool, dark places!
66) CULTIST1
{stern}Ahhh! Turn that off!
104) CULTIST1
{stern}Ahhh! Turn that off!
67) CULTIST2
{stern}You’re killing us here!
105) CULTIST2
{stern}You’re killing us here!
68) SAM
Well, at least the boiler still works.
69) CULTIST2
{stern}What is WRONG with you?
70) SAM
Oops, sorry.
71) SAM
{enthused}Lookit, Max! I’ve never been that good with hieroglyphics, but it looks like this tablet is all about us!
72) MAX
{realizing}Ooo! {cocky}What does it say about me?
73) SAM
{stern}Let’s see... you’re going to fight a monkey, get a bunch of magic weapons, {confused}merge with the collective unconsciousness to become one with infinity, {normal}and then destroy the universe.
74) MAX
{confused}Are you sure you’re not reading it backwards?
75) SAM
{confused}Hmmm... well if that’s the case, {Stern}you’re about to wrestle a crocodile and I’m going to turn into an owl.
76) MAX
{happy}I can hardly wait!
77) SAM
{stern}I’m tired of trying to read this thing. I’ll wait for the movie.

[pickup1] Leave in our moment of triumph? Surely you over-estimate the space ape’s chances!
87) SAM
[pickup1] That’s why I’m freaked out. Whatever’s in there, it has no respect for math.
88) SAM
[pickup1] Well, now I’m a little freaked out.
89) MAX
[pickup1] Why?
90) SAM
[pickup1] According to your Nutri-Specs, that box contains 90 percent evil, 50 percent chaos, and 30 percent childlike whimsy.
91) MAX
[pickup1] That’s 170 percent.
92) SAM
[pickup1] [reading] Gullibility, ignorance, well-founded feelings of inadequacy... yep, those are the ingredients of a cult member, all right.
93) MAX
[pickup1] What about potential for violence?
94) SAM
[pickup1] Only trace amounts.
95) MAX
[pickup1] Must be one of those wussy pacifist cults.
96) MAX
[pickup1] Where’s the fun in that?
97) SAM
[pickup1][reading] Hmmm. Maybe we don’t have to defeat Skunkape after all. If your Nutri-Specs are right, he’ll keel over from mercury poisoning in a few years anyway.
98) SAM
THAT won’t work.
99) SAM
[pickup1] It’s hard to believe that good old Steamy has been sporadically keeping our building warm for almost a century!
100) MAX
[pickup1] It’s even harder to believe that you’ve given it a cutesy nickname.
101) SAM
[pickup1] We better call a contractor to fix that hole in our basement once this scintillating adventure has come to its inevitably earth-shattering conclusion.
