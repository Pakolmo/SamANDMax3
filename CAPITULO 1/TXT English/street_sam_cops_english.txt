1) SAM
{confused}How are you guys supposed to help us fight crime?
2) MAX
{sarcastic}Yeah, you’re not even as powerful as a cell phone.
3) SAM
{Stern}[scolding] Max, that was completely uncalled for.

You guys should keep an eye on General Skunkape. {suspicious}We’re pretty sure he’s evil.
12) SYNTH
THAT GUY IS A TOTAL HEAT SINK.
13) BLEEPS
Blaaaaat!
14) MAX
We thought everybody else liked him except for us!
15) MOVIEFONE
His so-called “advanced technology” is going to make thousands of hard-working computers and robots lose their jobs.
16) SYNTH
WHEN BUYING TECHNOLOGY, LOOK FOR THE MADE-ON-EARTH LABEL.
17) SAM
{confused}Do you guys know where to find something called a “power core”?
18) MAX
{confused}What’s his problem?
19) MOVIEFONE
We were forced to witness Momma Bosco tearing apart circuit boards to construct her power core. We prefer not to talk about it.

IT WAS HORRIBLE.
21) BLEEPS
[panicked beeping] Bleep! Blap! Bloop! Bloop!
22) SYNTH
A REAL MOTHERBOARD.
23) MOVIEFONE
If you’d like to drive somewhere, use the handy city map contained in the glove box.

Talking to you guys is great and all, {confused}but could we have our car back?
25) MAX
Hey Sam,{confused} isn’t our car still possessed by demons?
26) SYNTH
IT IS NOT SO BAD AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT TRY TO RUN THE AIR CONDITIONER.
27) SAM
See ya, COPS.
28) SYNTH
