1) SAM
{Sad} I still can’t believe Bosco left town without saying goodbye.
2) SAM
{stern} Now we’ll have to go out into the city when we want to buy stuff.
3) MAX
{sarcastic} I don’t mind! I embrace change!
4) SAM
{incredulous} That’s hobos, Max. You embrace hobos.
5) MAX
{happy} Right. {confused}What did I say?
6) SAM
I know, I saw it, too! {confused} Somehow.
7) SKUNKAPE
I have come to you... with a message of {happy} peace and {cocky} love!
8) MAX
{happy} Hey, Sam! This haunted toy I found just gave me an uncanny vision of our violent future!
9) SKUNKAPE
{proud} Creatures of Earth! I am General Skun-ka’pe! Hear my words!
10) SAM
{realizing} It had a spaceship, a friendly alien brain in a jar, and an evil space gorilla trying to destroy the city. {confused}What could it all mean?
11) MAX
{confused} Did your version have credits?
12) SAM
{happy} It means we’ve got to find a way on board that spaceship, Max!
137) SAM
{happy} It means we’ve got to find a way on board that spaceship, Max!
13) MAX
{incredulous} Hmmm, what COULD it all mean?
136) MAX
{incredulous} Hmmm, what COULD it all mean?
14) SUPERBALL
{proud} Hello, sir, Mr. President.
15) SKUNKAPE
{surprised} President? {cocky}You are the ruler of this planet?
16) MAX
[modest] {surprised} Oh, no. {regal}I’m just President of the United States. We’re only one of many united nations working together to achieve...
17) SUPERBALL
{stern} We’re alone here, sir. You can speak freely.
18) MAX
[to Superball] {surprised} Oh, okay. [to Skunkape]{aloof}Yeah, I’m in charge, pretty much.
19) SKUNKAPE
[slightly menacing] {happy} Perfect! {proud}Just the one I wanted to see, ha ha ha ha ha!
20) SKUNKAPE
{surprised} No catch, ha ha ha! {cocky}All I ask in return is your help while my... {proud}research assistants search for... {cocky}an artifact of interest to my people.
21) SAM
[threatening] {suspicious} Keep the hands where we can see ‘em, pal.
22) SKUNKAPE
[cheerfully] {surprised} But of course! {proud}I have come to your pitif—beautiful world for a peaceful exchange of technology. All the wonders of the galaxy, yours! Ha ha ha ha ha!
23) SKUNKAPE
[quickly, embarrassed] {worried} Sorry about that building.
24) SAM
[suspicious] {suspicious} What’s the catch?
25) SAM
{sarcastic} It’s a good thing Sybil packed all her junk into these boxes for safe-keeping.
26) SKUNKAPE
[process loudspeaker] THERE they are! I don’t know how you escaped the Penal Zone, Sam & Max, but you will never escape my disintegrator eyes! Ha ha ha ha ha!
27) SAM
{worried} Gee, I hope Sybil’s stuff is okay.
28) MAX
{incredulous}You live on our street, there’s a good chance you’re gonna get blown up. {aloof}She should understand that by now, Sam.
29) SAM
Yeah, this way’s a lot cheaper, and {happy} EVERYBODY gets to enjoy it!
30) MAX
{sarcastic} And I’m especially glad we didn’t put it in a secure, environmentally regulated storage facility like she asked us to.
31) SAM
[reading] {stern} “BoscoTech Labs. Visit our new location.”
32) SAM
{incredulous} Well, this is kind of a bad neighborhood to be a ghost. All the best cemeteries are on the other side of town.
33) MAX
{surprised} Oh, {suspicious} so Momma Bosco’s too good to haunt {angry} our street anymore?
34) MAX
My brain feels all tingly, Sam. It tingles with usefulness.
35) MAX
I can’t believe Skunkape just let us walk into his ship unsupervised. It’s like he’s never even met us.
36) MAX
I’m tired of interdimensional space gorillas, Sam. Let’s go for a drive.
37) MAX
I can’t believe Skunkape lets us just walk into his ship unsupervised. It’s like he’s never even met us.
38) MAX
I miss Grandpa Stinky and his blasphemous recipes.
39) MAX
Let’s go talk to Momma Bosco! I respect her because she’s smart, sassy, and semi-transparent.
40) MAX
Let’s take the DeSoto for a spin, Sam. I want to see what evil the COPS have wrought.
41) SKUNKAPE
[enthusiastic listening] {Happy}Yes... YES!
42) SKUNKAPE
[enthusiastic listening] {Happy} Yes! Ha ha ha!
43) SKUNKAPE
[enthusiastic listening] {Happy} Yes, go on!
44) SKUNKAPE
[enthusiastic listening] {Happy} Mahvelous!
45) SKUNKAPE
[enthusiastic listening] {Happy}Yes, I see!
46) SAM
{stern} Locked out of our own building, {sarcastic} like computer science majors from a sorority house.
47) MAX
{confused} Why do they have to do a “seismic retrofitting” anyway, Sam? We don’t live on a fault line!
48) SAM
{confused} I don’t know, Max. The letter from the city said something about robot and alien attacks and weekly explosions. {stern}A lot of bureaucratic nonsense.
49) SAM
[reading newspaper] “City Dirtification Project a Resounding Success.”
50) SAM
[reading newspaper] “Mayor credits New Jersey’s rich supplies of rust, grime, crud, and skank.”
51) SAM
[reading newspaper] “Aliens Invade City.”
52) SAM
{surprised} Wow, those newspaper guys are getting {stern} pretty aggressive with their up-to-date reporting.
53) MAX
[not impressed] {aloof} Eh, they probably just write a bunch of alien gorilla stories in advance and just change the dates.
54) SAM
[reading newspaper] “General Skunkape Named Savior of Humanity.”
55) MAX
[not impressed] {aloof} Eh, they named ME savior of humanity once, and THAT didn’t last.
56) SAM
[reading newspaper] “Alien Gorilla on City-Wide Terror Spree.”
57) MAX
Now can you really call it a “spree” if he’s just attacking the two of us?
58) SAM
{incredulous} Did you remember to feed the parking meter, Max?
59) MAX
{suspicious} I slaved all day over a hot stove for it, and do I hear a word of thanks?
60) SAM
{suspicious} I think your expletive-laden acceptance speech is what started the backlash.
61) SAM
{worried} Oops, I’m sorry. I’ve got the wrong number.
62) SAM
[poorly disguising his voice] {sarcastic} See you wherever that is, then... uh, my love.
63) SAM
[panic, terrified] {surprised} Max, NO! Not the Chrysler building!
64) MAX
{happy} That sounds fun, I can hardly wait!
65) SAM
{confused} I can’t use these two things together.
66) MAX
{aloof} I really need to get a partner with a more interesting future.
67) SAM
{sarcastic} Gee, little buddy, here in 2109 our street looks pretty much the same as it did a hundred years ago!
68) MAX
[gruff] {devilish} Keep moving, Earthling! Emperor Skun-ka’pe II has demanded tribute!
69) SAM
{sad} You used to be so much cooler, Max.
70) SAM
[reading newspaper] “Sam & Max Save Earth from Alien Invader.”
71) MAX
{sad} Aww, I gave away the ending.
72) SAM
[reading newspaper] “Max Rampage In Fourth Devastating Week.”
73) SAM
{scared} “Devastating rampage”? {suspicious} Just what have you got planned, Max?
74) MAX
{sarcastic} Just my usual Tuesday night rampage, nothing that would make the newspapers.

[pickup1] {angry} I don’t have time for your shenanigans.
87) NARRATOR
[pickup1] My friends, you seem a bit confused. But there’s no cause for alarm, we’ve merely let the story get ahead of itself. Let’s take a brief journey back to properly set the scene.
88) NARRATOR
[pickup1] Our story begins twenty-five minutes ago, on a street very much like this one.
89) MAX
{stern}[pickup1] [defensive] It wasn’t my fault this time!
90) SAM
{enthused}[pickup1] [talking on phone] This is Sam & Max, Freelance Police! Mobile Division.
91) SAM
[pickup1] [talking on phone] {normal}Hello, Commissioner... {sarcastic}No, we’re not in the office, we’re locked out of our building.
92) MAX
[pickup1] {suspicious}[upset] One gaping, treacherous crack in the street and those pansies from City Hall {stern}shut down the whole block!
93) SAM
[pickup1] [casual conversation, to fill up time] {confused}What’s that, Commissioner? A sudden wave of lawfulness and goodwill spreading through the city? No, we didn’t have anything to do with that.
94) SAM
[pickup1] [casually] I’ll have to call you back, Commissioner. Max has psychic powers now, apparently.
95) MAX
[pickup1] [intoning, creepy, ominous vision] The brain is dying.
96) NARRATOR
[pickup1] That should bring us all up to speed. Now, where were we? Something about a spaceship?
97) MOVIEFONE
[pickup1] You’ve got a phone call!
98) SAM
[pickup1] Agent Superball is comprised of 20 percent mystery and 80 percent sheer awesome.
99) MAX
[pickup1] Hmm, that’s down ten percent from last season.
100) MAX
[pickup1] Where’s the fun in that?
101) SAM
[pickup1][reading] Hmmm. Maybe we don’t have to defeat Skunkape after all. If your Nutri-Specs are right, he’ll keel over from mercury poisoning in a few years anyway.
102) SAM
[pickup1] Even if I COULD toss the phone in our office, we never get reception because of the dead zone.
103) MAX
[pickup1] [spooky] {Stern} The dead zone that emanates from the fiery pits of Hell below our building.
104) SAM
[pickup1] Besides, there’s nothing useful in our office anyway.
105) SAM
[pickup1] I’m not giving this away to the bad guy! I’ll save it for somebody who really needs it.
106) SAM
[pickup1] [context: bitter film noir Sam from 303] I’m not gonna rest until I find the guy who killed my partner!
107) MAX
[pickup1] Killed your partner? Is there something you’re not telling me?
108) SAM
[pickup1] Must be ominous foreshadowing, pal. Whatever the case, I’m going to sound really cool in the future!
109) MAX
[pickup1] Hey, look, Sam! It likes me!
110) SAM
[pickup1] [panic] Don’t look at it, Max! Stand clear of its unholy power!
111) SAM
[pickup1] [context: talking about a vision] That one was kind of hazy. It must happen a lot later.
112) SAM
[pickup1] It’s General Skunkape’s horrible spaceship. Good likeness.
113) SAM
[pickup1] [start out scolding, then getting worried] Max, what’s wrong with you? Max? Little buddy?
114) SAM
[pickup1] Well, THAT didn’t sound good.
115) MAX
[pickup1] [dismissive] Ah, that was one of the “distant future” ones. We don’t have to worry about it for a while.
116) SAM
[pickup1] [zombie-like drone] Toys... toys... we must prepare... the toys...
117) MAX
[pickup1] Well, that’s just a typical Friday night for YOU, Sam.
118) SAM
[pickup1] I hate to have to do this, Max, but it’s the only way to save the city!
119) MAX
[pickup1] What the heck was THAT all about?
120) SAM
[pickup1] No clue, Max. Your future visions need an index or something.
121) SAM
[pickup1] [context: giving Max fashion advice] I don’t know, Max. I know that Nehru jackets are back in style, but maybe it’s just not the style for YOU.
122) SAM
[pickup1] Well, I guess they can’t ALL be helpful visions.
123) MAX
[pickup1] [haunted] I was just about to BUY a Nehru jacket. Creepy!
124) SAM
[pickup1] It’s been months and they still haven’t sealed up this crack. Somebody should do something about it.
125) MAX
[pickup1] I say we all wear gray ribbons to raise crack awareness.
126) SAM
[pickup1] {Normal} I don’t want to fill the subway station with litter. {Sarcastic}Well, any more than it already is.
127) SAM
[pickup1] [reading] “Stinkys’ Diner.”
128) SAM
[pickup1] In the mood for some delicious, nutritious food, Max?
129) MAX
[pickup1] Not at all.
130) SAM
[pickup1] Then we’ve come to the right place.
