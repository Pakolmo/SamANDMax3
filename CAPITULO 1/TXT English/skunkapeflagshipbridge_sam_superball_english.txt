1) SUPERBALL
{stern} Hello Sam, {proud} Mr. President. If you have a moment, you need to be debriefed.
2) MAX
[mock surprise] {aloof} No!
3) MAX
{happy} Too late!
4) SUPERBALL
{normal} This may come as a shock, but our intel indicates that General Skun-ka’pe is actually quite evil.
5) SUPERBALL
Questions? Ask me. {proud}I’m here to help.
6) SUPERBALL
{stern} Penal. It’s an interdimensional prison for the most dangerous villains in the universe.
7) SAM
{suspicious} Okay, what’s the REAL story behind Skunkape?
8) SUPERBALL
General Skun-ka’pe is an intergalactic criminal warlord. There’s been a galaxy-wide gorilla hunt in effect ever since he escaped from the Penal Zone.
9) MAX
{confused} The what zone?
10) SAM
{confused} How are we supposed to get Skunkape back into the Penal Zone?
11) SUPERBALL
The United Planets have simple and easily reproducible fail-safe measures in place to handle escaped convicts.
12) SAM
{sarcastic} Well, that’s a relief.
13) SUPERBALL
All we need to do is open an unstable transdimensional gateway to the Penal Zone and his prisoner’s badge will take care of the rest.
14) SAM
Where is Skunkape now?
15) SUPERBALL
We can’t track him without his homing beacon, sir. This will require some traditional detective work.
16) SAM
{confused} Will reckless and irrational detective work do?
17) MAX
{sarcastic} ‘Cause that’s all we know.
18) SUPERBALL
I’d recommend starting with some of his known contacts.
19) SAM
We have to open an unstable transdimensional gateway?
20) MAX
{angry} You must have lost your senses, man! The odds against that are astronomical!
21) SAM
{stern} Even if we DID know what that was!
22) SUPERBALL
The gateway is the easy part, sirs. Doctor Momma Bosco’s reckless and blasphemous work tearing down the fabric of reality could be useful.
23) SAM
What do we need from Momma Bosco?
24) SUPERBALL
Her dimensional destabilizer can open a gateway to the Penal Zone. {Stern}Anyone wearing a prisoner’s homing beacon will be returned to justice automatically and scientifically.
25) SAM
I didn’t notice Skunkape wearing any kind of badge or homing beacon.
26) MAX
{incredulous} Whoa, whoa, calm down. {aloof}We can’t think with all your hysterics.
27) SUPERBALL
That’s because he wasn’t wearing one, sir. {Stern}I find it extraordinarily alarming.
28) SUPERBALL
Forgive me, Mr. President. But unless you can find General Skun-ka’pe’s homing beacon and place it on him, {Stern} we’re powerless to stop him.
29) SAM
What did this homing beacon look like?
30) SUPERBALL
It’s a standard issue intergalactic correctional facility inmate’s badge.
31) SUPERBALL
{Stern} It can’t be destroyed, so the only way he could’ve gotten rid of it is by giving it to someone else.
32) SAM
{suspicious} I’m pretty sure I never heard of a “Department of Homeworld Security,” Agent Superball.
33) SUPERBALL
{Stern} It’s explained in books, sir.
34) MAX
{realizing} Oh, right.
35) SUPERBALL
Established in 1901 by Theodore Roosevelt after President McKinley’s assassination by one of the Insectaurs of the Nebulon Empire.
36) MAX
{surprised} I’m President of the United States! {suspicious} Why didn’t I hear anything about it?
37) SAM
{sarcastic} Is that why you were hanging out in our office so much last season... {surprised}I mean a few months ago? {suspicious}To protect Max?
38) SUPERBALL
[lying] Um... sure.
39) MAX
{sarcastic} Wow. I feel really very close to you now, Agent Superball.
40) SUPERBALL
Likewise, sir. {stern}A bit TOO close.
41) MAX
{devilish} Right in the Penal Zone!
42) SUPERBALL
Yes, I get it sir.
43) SAM
{enthused} Don’t worry, Superball! We’ll hit that gorilla where it hurts the most!
44) SAM
{enthused} Stay vigilant, Superball!
45) SUPERBALL
Roger that.
46) SUPERBALL
You should start by looking for people he’s associated with.
47) MAX
{confused} Freemasons?
48) SAM
{suspicious} Or his new “queen,” Stinky!
